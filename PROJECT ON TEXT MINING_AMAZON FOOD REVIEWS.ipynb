       "'I have bought several of the Vitality canned dog food products and have found them all to be of good quality . The product looks more like a stew than a processed meat and it smells better . My Labrador is finicky and she appreciates this product better than most . Product arrived labeled as Jumbo Salted Peanuts ... the peanuts were actually small sized unsalted . Not sure if this was an error or if the vendor intended to represent the product as \" Jumbo \" . This is a confection that has been around a few centuries . It is a light , pillowy citrus gelatin with nuts - in this case Filberts . And it is cut into tiny squares and then liberally coated with powdered sugar . And it is a tiny mouthful of heaven . Not too chewy , and very flavorful . I highly recommend this yummy treat . If you are familiar with the story of C . S . Lewis \\' \" The Lion , The Witch , and The Wardrobe \" - this is the treat that seduces Edmund into selling out his Brother and Sisters to the Witch . If you are looking for the secret ingredient in Robitussin I believe I have found it . I got this in addition to the Root Beer Extract I ordered ( which was good ) and made some cherry soda . The flavor is very medicinal . Great taffy at a great price . There was a wide assortment of yummy taffy . Delivery was very quick . If your a taffy lover , this is a deal . I got a wild hair for taffy and ordered this five pound bag . The taffy was all very enjoyable with many flavors : watermelon , root beer , melon , peppermint , grape , etc . My only complaint is there was a bit too much red / black licorice-flavored pieces ( just not my particular favorites ) . Between me , my kids , and my husband , this lasted only two weeks ! I would recommend this brand of taffy - - it was a delightful treat . This saltwater taffy had great flavors and was very soft and chewy . Each candy was individually wrapped well . None of the candies were stuck together , which did happen in the expensive version , Fralinger\\'s . Would highly recommend this candy ! I served it at a beach-themed party and everyone loved it ! This taffy is so good . It is very soft and chewy . The flavors are amazing . I would definitely recommend you buying it . Very satisfying ! ! Right now I\\'m mostly just sprouting this so my cats can eat the grass . They love it . I rotate it around with Wheatgrass and Rye too This is a very healthy dog food . Good for their digestion . Also good for small puppies . My dog eats her required amount at every feeding . I don\\'t know if it\\'s the cactus or the tequila or just the unique combination of ingredients , but the flavour of this hot sauce makes it one of a kind ! We picked up a bottle once on a trip we were on and brought it back home with us and were totally blown away ! When we realized that we simply couldn\\'t find it anywhere in our city we were bummed . < br / > < br / > Now , because of the magic of the internet , we have a case of the sauce and are ecstatic because of it . < br / > < br / > If you love hot sauce .. I mean really love hot sauce , but don\\'t want a sauce that tastelessly burns your throat , grab a bottle of Tequila Picante Gourmet de Inclan . Just realize that once you taste it , you will never want to use any other sauce . < br / > < br / > Thank you for the personal , incredible service ! One of my boys needed to lose some weight and the other didn\\'t . I put this food on the floor for the chubby guy , and the protein-rich , no by-product food up higher where only my skinny boy can jump . The higher food sits going stale . They both really go for this food . And my chubby boy has been losing about an ounce a week . My cats have been happily eating Felidae Platinum for more than two years . I just got a new bag and the shape of the food is different . They tried the new food when I first put it in their bowls and now the bowls sit full and the kitties will not touch the food . I\\'ve noticed similar reviews related to formula changes in the past . Unfortunately , I now need to find a new food that my cats will eat . good flavor ! these came securely packed ... they were fresh and delicious ! i love these Twizzlers ! The Strawberry Twizzlers are my guilty pleasure - yummy . Six pounds will be around for a while with my son and I . My daughter loves twizzlers and this shipment of six pounds really hit the spot . It\\'s exactly what you would expect ... six packages of strawberry twizzlers . I love eating them and they are good for watching TV and looking at movies ! It is not too sweet . I like to transfer them to a zip lock baggie so they stay fresh so I can take my time eating them . I am very satisfied with my Twizzler purchase . I shared these with others and we have all enjoyed them . I will definitely be ordering more . Twizzlers , Strawberry my childhood favorite candy , made in Lancaster Pennsylvania by Y & S Candies , Inc . one of the oldest confectionery Firms in the United States , now a Subsidiary of the Hershey Company , the Company was established in 1845 as Young and Smylie , they also make Apple Licorice Twists , Green Color and Blue Raspberry Licorice Twists , I like them all < br / > < br / > I keep it in a dry cool place because is not recommended it to put it in the fridge . According to the Guinness Book of Records , the longest Licorice Twist ever made measured 1.200 Feet ( 370 M ) and weighted 100 Pounds ( 45 Kg ) and was made by Y & S Candies , Inc . This Record-Breaking Twist became a Guinness World Record on July 19 , 1998 . This Product is Kosher ! Thank You Candy was delivered very fast and was purchased at a reasonable price . I was home bound and unable to get to a store so this was perfect for me . My husband is a Twizzlers addict . We\\'ve bought these many times from Amazon because we\\'re government employees living overseas and can\\'t get them in the country we are assigned to . They\\'ve always been fresh and tasty , packed well and arrive in a timely manner . I bought these for my husband who is currently overseas . He loves these , and apparently his staff likes them also . < br / > There are generous amounts of Twizzlers in each 16 - ounce bag , and this was well worth the price . < a href = \" http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GVISJM \" > Twizzlers , Strawberry , 16 - Ounce Bags ( Pack of 6 ) </a> I can remember buying this candy as a kid and the quality hasn\\'t dropped in all these years . Still a superb product you won\\'t be disappointed with . I love this candy . After weight watchers I had to cut back but still have a craving for it . I have lived out of the US for over 7 yrs now , and I so miss my Twizzlers ! ! When I go back to visit or someone visits me , I always stock up . All I can say is YUM ! < br / > Sell these in Mexico and you will have a faithful buyer , more often than I\\'m able to buy them right now . Product received is as advertised . < br / > < br / > < a href = \" http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GVISJM \" > Twizzlers , Strawberry , 16 - Ounce Bags ( Pack of 6 ) </a> The candy is just red , No flavor . Just plan and chewy . I would never buy them again I was so glad Amazon carried these batteries . I have a hard time finding them elsewhere because they are such a unique size . I need them for my garage door opener . < br / > Great deal for the price . I got this for my Mum who is not diabetic but needs to watch her sugar intake , and my father who simply chooses to limit unnecessary sugar intake - she\\'s the one with the sweet tooth - they both LOVED these toffees , you would never guess that they\\'re sugar-free and it\\'s so great that you can eat them pretty much guilt free ! i was so impressed that i\\'ve ordered some for myself ( w dark chocolate ) to take to the office so i\\'ll eat them instead of snacking on sugary sweets . < br / > These are just EXCELLENT ! I don\\'t know if it\\'s the cactus or the tequila or just the unique combination of ingredients , but the flavour of this hot sauce makes it one of a kind ! We picked up a bottle once on a trip we were on and brought it back home with us and were totally blown away ! When we realized that we simply couldn\\'t find it anywhere in our city we were bummed . < br / > < br / > Now , because of the magic of the internet , we have a case of the sauce and are ecstatic because of it . < br / > < br / > If you love hot sauce .. I mean really love hot sauce , but don\\'t want a sauce that tastelessly burns your throat , grab a bottle of Tequila Picante Gourmet de Inclan . Just realize that once you taste it , you will never want to use any other sauce . < br / > < br / > Thank you for the personal , incredible service ! I have never been a huge coffee fan . However , my mother purchased this little machine and talked me into trying the Latte Macciato . No Coffee Shop has a better one and I like most of the other products , too ( as a usually non-coffee drinker ! ) . < br / > The little Dolche Guesto Machine is super easy to use and prepares a really good Coffee / Latte / Cappuccino / etc in less than a minute ( if water is heated up ) . I would recommend the Dolce Gusto to anyone . Too good for the price and I\\'am getting one myself ! :) This offer is a great price and a great taste , thanks Amazon for selling this product . < br / > < br / > Staral McCann\\'s Instant Oatmeal is great if you must have your oatmeal but can only scrape together two or three minutes to prepare it . There is no escaping the fact , however , that even the best instant oatmeal is nowhere near as good as even a store brand of oatmeal requiring stovetop preparation . Still , the McCann\\'s is as good as it gets for instant oatmeal . It\\'s even better than the organic , all-natural brands I have tried . All the varieties in the McCann\\'s variety pack taste good . It can be prepared in the microwave or by adding boiling water so it is convenient in the extreme when time is an issue . < br / > < br / > McCann\\'s use of actual cane sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup helped me decide to buy this product . Real sugar tastes better and is not as harmful as the other stuff . One thing I do not like , though , is McCann\\'s use of thickeners . Oats plus water plus heat should make a creamy , tasty oatmeal without the need for guar gum . But this is a convenience product . Maybe the guar gum is why , after sitting in the bowl a while , the instant McCann\\'s becomes too thick and gluey . This is a good instant oatmeal from the best oatmeal brand . It uses cane sugar instead of high fructouse corn syrup , so not only does it have a better sweetness , but some doctors now say that this form of sugar is better for you . Great on a cold morning when you don\\'t have time to make McCann\\'s Steel Cut Oats . The apple cinnamon is the best but the maple and brown sugar or the regular are good too . Plus they don\\'t require doctoring to actually tell the three flavors apart . Instant oatmeal can become soggy the minute the water hits the bowl . McCann\\'s Instant Oatmeal holds its texture , has excellent flavor , and is good for you all at the same time . McCann\\'s regular oat meal is excellent , too , but may take a bit longer to prepare than most have time for in the morning . This is the best instant brand I\\'ve ever eaten , and a very close second to the non-instant variety . < br / > < br / > McCann\\'s Instant Irish Oatmeal , Variety Pack of Regular , Apples & Cinnamon , and Maple & Brown Sugar , 10 - Count Boxes ( Pack of 6 ) McCann\\'s Instant Irish Oatmeal , Variety Pack of Regular , Apples & Cinnamon , and Maple & Brown Sugar , 10 - Count Boxes ( Pack of 6 ) < br / > < br / > I\\'m a fan of the McCann\\'s steel-cut oats , so I thought I\\'d give the instant variety a try . I found it to be a hardy meal , not too sweet , and great for folks like me ( post-bariatric surgery ) who need food that is palatable , easily digestible , with fiber but won\\'t make you bloat . For those of us with celiac disease this product is a lifesaver and what could be better than getting it at almost half the price of the grocery or health food store ! I love McCann\\'s instant oatmeal - all flavors ! ! ! < br / > < br / > Thanks , < br / > Abby What else do you need to know ? Oatmeal , instant ( make it with a half cup of low-fat milk and add raisins ; nuke for 90 seconds ) . More expensive than Kroger store brand oatmeal and maybe a little tastier or better texture or something . It\\'s still just oatmeal . Mmm , convenient ! I WAS VISITING MY FRIEND NATE THE OTHER MORNING FOR COFFEE , HE CAME OUT OF HIS STORAGE ROOM WITH ( A PACKET OF McCANNS INSTANT IRISH OATMEAL . ) HE SUGGESTED THAT I TRY IT FOR MY OWN USE , IN MY STASH . SOMETIMES NATE DOSE NOT GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO SAY NO , SO I ENDED UP TRYING THE APPLE AND CINN . FOUND IT TO BE VERY TASTEFULL WHEN MADE WITH WATER OR POWDERED MILK . IT GOES GOOD WITH O . J . AND COFFEE AND A SLICE OF TOAST AND YOUR READY TO TAKE ON THE WORLD ... OR THE DAY AT LEAST .. JERRY REITH ... I ordered this for my wife as it was reccomended by our daughter . She has this almost every morning and likes all flavors . She\\'s happy , I\\'m happy ! ! ! < br / > < a href = \" http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5QW8 \" > McCANN\\'S Instant Irish Oatmeal , Variety Pack of Regular , Apples & Cinnamon , and Maple & Brown Sugar , 10 - Count Boxes ( Pack of 6 ) </a> The variety packs taste great ! < br / > < br / > I have them every morning . At $ 0.30 cents per meal , I don\\'t understand why everyone on earth isn\\'t buying this stuff up . < br / > < br / > Maple and brown sugar is terrific , followed by apples and cinnamon , followed by regular . You don\\'t get tired of the same ole thing , and they taste great . < br / > < br / > I just boil water from a small pot , empty the packet or 2 in a bowl , pour in boiling water , and watch it expand to 2x its size ! < br / > < br / > Taste really good and takes minutes to prepare . < br / > < br / > Not sure why everyone on earth isn\\'t this . Convenient , healthy , very quick , excellent quality , and extremely cheap ... McCann\\'s makes oatmeal for every oatmeal connoisseur , whether one likes it from the raw pellet state that cooks for half an hour , to the sloth addled instant , which can be done in the microwave for under three minutes . It\\'s all good , that\\'s for sure , and the beauty of the instant variety is that it is available in different flavors as well as regular . < br / > This variety pack allows different tastes to be explored , as well as giving you a chance to experience the difference between McCann\\'s and other well-known oatmeals . What I personally like about McCann\\'s is that it cooks up thicker and with more body than the top brand here in America . The Apples & Cinnamon , though , tends to be a little liquidy so you may want to experiment with the amount of water you add . In my 1300watt microwave the oatmeal cooks up in about one minute and twenty-seven seconds , so you should also watch that to get a handle on how much time and water to use . < br / > The only bad thing - - if you can consider it a bad thing - - about this offering is that you have to buy in lot so you\\'ll end up with six ten-count boxes . This is good if you have a whole family of oatmeal-eaters , but if you\\'re a single person alone - - well , love oatmeal . I have McCann\\'s Oatmeal every morning and by ordering it from Amazon I am able to save almost $ 3.00 per box . < br / > It is a great product . Tastes great and very healthy McCann\\'s Oatmeal is a good quality choice . Our favorite is the Apples and Cinnamon , but we find that none of these are overly sugary . For a good hot breakfast in 2 minutes , this is excellent . We really like the McCann\\'s steel cut oats but find we don\\'t cook it up too often . < br / > This tastes much better to me than the grocery store brands and is just as convenient . < br / > Anything that keeps me eating oatmeal regularly is a good thing . This seems a little more wholesome than some of the supermarket brands , but it is somewhat mushy and doesn\\'t have quite as much flavor either . It didn\\'t pass muster with my kids , so I probably won\\'t buy it again . Good oatmeal . I like the apple cinnamon the best . Though I wouldn\\'t follow the directions on the package since it always comes out too soupy for my taste . That could just be me since I like my oatmeal really thick to add some milk on top of . The flavors are good . However , I do not see any differce between this and Oaker Oats brand - they are both mushy . I really like the Maple and Brown Sugar flavor . The regular is fine with brown sugar added . The Apples and Cinnamon flavor is OK . This is a very quick , easy and satisfying breakfast and I\\'ll order this brand again , but not the variety . I\\'ll get all Maple and Brown Sugar . This is the same stuff you can buy at the big box stores . There is nothing healthy about it . It is just carbs and sugars . Save your money and get something that at least has some taste . This oatmeal is not good . Its mushy , soft , I don\\'t like it . Quaker Oats is the way to go . Got a free package of these with a bottle of bloody mary mix I bought from the seller , and the advertising worked .. lol , I tried them , and shared them with 2 buddies , and we all loved them ... So im here to buy more , and noticed there were no reviews yet , ... well now there is . They are Hot , but not \" burn your mouth forever hot \" its a nice temp ... Perfect for us .. This wasn\\'t in stock the last time I looked . I had to go to the Vermont Country Store in Weston to find it along with a jaw harp , Cranberry Horseradish Sauce , Fartless Black Bean Salsa , Apple Cider Jelly , Newton\\'s Cradle Art in Motion and the staple Vermont Maple Syrup . < br / > < br / > Back to the Ass Kickin Peanuts . They are hot . They will activate the perspiration glands behind your ears and under your arms . It requires a beverage as advertised , a glass of very cold milk , and a box of Kleenex since it will make your nose run . They look like ordinary peanuts which is already giving me ideas for work . I suspect that some people have been hitting my goodies in my absence , especially my colleague Greg . I\\'m going to take this to work at earliest opportunity and empty the contents of this can into an ordinary Planters Peanuts can , and then see whose crying or whose nose is running when I return . < br / > < br / > The can should be shaken to ensure the spices are evenly distributed . It is important to wash your hands after consumption and not touch the eyes . < br / > < br / > You\\'ll go nuts over these Ass-Kickin \\' Peanuts . < br / > < br / > P . S . I\\'m not sharing the peanuts , not deliberately , and I\\'ll probably give Greg the jaw harp for Christmas . He\\'ll be so insulted . we\\'re used to spicy foods down here in south texas and these are not at all spicy . doubt very much habanero is used at all . could take it up a notch or two . I roast at home with a stove-top popcorn popper ( but I do it outside , of course ) . These beans ( Coffee Bean Direct Green Mexican Altura ) seem to be well-suited for this method . The first and second cracks are distinct , and I\\'ve roasted the beans from medium to slightly dark with great results every time . The aroma is strong and persistent . The taste is smooth , velvety , yet lively . We roast these in a large cast iron pan on the grill ( about 1/3 of the bag at a time ) . The smell is wonderful and the roasted beans taste delicious too . More importantly , the coffee is smooth ; no bitter aftertaste . On numerous occasions , we\\'ve had to send the roasted beans home with friends because they like it so much . Deal was awesome ! Arrived before Halloween as indicated and was enough to satisfy trick or treaters . I love the quality of this product and it was much less expensive than the local store\\'s candy . It is chocolate , what can I say . Great variety of everything our family loves . With a family of six it goes fast here . Perfect variety . Kit Kat , Reeses , take five and more . Great product , nice combination of chocolates and perfect size ! The bags had plenty , and they were shipped promptly . The kids in the neighborhood liked our candies ! Halloween is over but , I sent a bag to my daughters class for her share . The chocolate was fresh and enjoyed by many . Watch your prices with this . While the assortment was good , and I did get this on a gold box purchase , the price for this was < br / > $ 3-4 less at Target . This bag of candy online is pretty expensive , it should be cheaper in order to compete with grocery stores , other than that , its a good combination of my favorite candy Arrived in 6 days and were so stale i could not eat any of the 6 bags ! ! I have used the endurolyte product for several years in both pill and powder form . Long desert rides on the dirt bike always found my camelbak water heavily laced with the endurolyte powder , not overly tasty , but quite effective , as I never got a cramp on these several hundred mile rides . Same for desert racing in the buggy , the camelbaks were always laced with the powder . Now we have the Fizz ... what a great product ! Firstly , its Hammer\\'s endurolyte product so it\\'s great , endurance athlete\\'s the world over use their products . Second its convenient , handly tablets that dissovle in a fizz . Third it tastes great ! Imagine getting a nice cool drink when your body is starving for hydration and electrolytes and rather than getting a \" salty \" taste , you get a refreshing lemon-lime or mango ! The camelbaks always get the Fizz now . I also drop a tablet in my bottled water whenever I exercise and have a nice flavored water chock full of electrolytes . I cannot recommend this product or any hammer product highly enough . This product serves me well as a source of electrolytes during and after a long run or bike ride . < br / > I have tried all of the flavors but really do like the grapefruit flavor ... no after-taste and I actually like the slight carbonation . < br / > I use other Hammer products and really like their whole product line . This stuff really works for preventing cramping during the middle to latter stages of your rides . Pop 1 into each water bottle and you\\'re set . Flavor is fine and goes down easy . For those of us on a low carb diet these little tablets are just the thing . < br / > < br / > Two years ago I started cycling again after many years but was having heart arrhythmia after longer rides in high heat . I was drinking plain water but did a little research and thought electrolytes might be the issue . Gatorade wasn\\'t an option because it is so loaded with carbohydrates so I looked around for a low-carb alternative . The \" zero carb \" sports drinks didn\\'t help so what to do ? One day I ran across these at my bike shop so tried a tube of them ... voila ! ... problem solved ! ! < br / > < br / > I\\'ve shared them with two friends in particular whose problems with leg cramps were resolved while using these . < br / > < br / > These guys got it right - - they are superbly formulated and simply work ... I purchased the Mango flavor , and to me it doesn\\'t take like Mango at all . There is no hint of sweetness , and unfortunately there is a hint or aftertaste almost like licorice . I\\'ve been consuming various sports nutrition products for decades , so I\\'m familiar and have come to like the taste of the most of the products I\\'ve tried . The mango flavor is one of the least appealing I\\'ve tasted . It\\'s not terrible , but it\\'s bad enough that I notice the bad taste every sip I take . If you\\'re impulsive like me , then $ 6 is ok . Don\\'t get me wrong , the quality of these babies is very good and I have no complaints . But in retrospect , the price is a little ridiculous ( esp . when you add on the shipping ) . this was sooooo deliscious but too bad i ate em too fast and gained 2 pds ! my fault These Albanese gummi bears and rings and so on are very good and tasty and high quality . The bears even have little faces . At my local candy store this type of gummi stuff ( bears , rings , snakes , balls , worms , whatever ) are about $ 10 / lb . These twin packs of 4.5 or 5 pound bags is a screaming deal as far as I\\'m concerned . I\\'m probably 50 pounds deep in these friggin \\' things . Consumed ! Grape gummy bears are hard to find in my area . In fact pretty much anyone I talk to about grape gummy bears they think I\\'m lying . So I bought 10lbs ... : ) These bears are a little bit bigger then the other brands and have kind of sour kick , but nothing to strong . I love grape flavored candy / soda and these are pretty good . There is another company that makes grape gummy bears that are a little bit better in my opinion , but these are well worth it for the price . I like to use the gummy bears in home made Popsicles with flavored sports drink . The salt in the sports drink makes for softer popsicles , and the gummy bears are awesome frozen . They are delicious ! I ordered two of these and two of raspberry latice tarts directly from FantasiCakes website for a dinner party I was hosting . It arrived fresh and intact . Very good size . I froze half for later use . I am a pastry lover and these were the best I\\'ve ever tasted . The pastry was soft , the jam was really good and the taste was great . They were gone in no time . My guests were really impressed . Buyer Beware Please ! This sweetener is not for everybody . Maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body . You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience . Nausea , diarrhea & headaches can also be experienced . I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugar-free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell . I thought I\\'d found sugar-free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in . The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before . I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping . As the symptoms passed , this too was very unpleasant . Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit , all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate . My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugar-free popcorn at my local market . The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy , new sugarfree treat taste so good , my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener * down to the very bottom of the label and read \" maltitol \" in tiny little letters ! Thank goodness I\\'d eaten only a little . I still ended up with all the same side-effects but for a much shorter duration . Some people can use maltitol to their heart\\'s content but others , like me , can have a bad reaction to it . In case you\\'re like me , ... it\\'s not you ... it\\'s the maltitol ! It is okay . I would not go out of my way to buy it again No tea flavor at all . Just whole brunch of artifial flavors . It is not returnable . I wasted 20 + bucks . These looked like a perfect snack to through in with my trail mix . Unfortunately , they arrived in a solid mass of melted chocolate . I left them in my pantry for a few days , and when I opened them at room temperature they were still gooey . I through them in the fridge and I\\'ve been breaking off hunks ever since . They taste good to me , but the chocolate is all grainy after melting and then solidifying again . I won\\'t order them online again , but if I see them in a store I would pick them up . These taste really good . I have been purchasing a different brand and these are very similar in taste and texture . I agree with the other reviewer regarding ordering in the summer . There is no insulating packaging with ice packs so they will melt in warm weather like all chocolate food items . Order in cold weather and buy enough to last ! ! ! The taste was great , but the berries had melted . May order again in winter . If you order in cold weather you should enjoy flavor . i know i cannot make tea this good . granted , i am not from the south but i know i have never enjoyed tea that was this sweet without being too sweet . it tastes crisp . This peppermint stick is delicious and fun to eat . My dad got me one for Christmas because he remembered me having a similar one when I was a little girl . I\\'m 30 now and I love it ! Great gift for all ages ! I purchased these giant canes before and the recipients loved them so much , they kept them and would not eat them . I know the product title says Molecular Gastronomy , but don\\'t let that scare you off . I have been looking for this for a while now , not for food science , but for something more down to earth . I use it to make my own coffee creamer . < br / > < br / > I have to have my coffee blonde and sweet - but the flavored creamers are full of the bad kinds of fat , and honestly , I hate to use manufactured \" food \" items . I really don\\'t think they are good for the body . On the other hand , I hate using cold milk or cream , because I like HOT coffee . < br / > < br / > I stumbled across this on Amazon one day and got the idea of making my own creamer . I also bought low-fat ( non-instant ) milk powder and regular milk powder . The non-instant lowfat milk is a little sweeter and tastes fresher than regular instant low-fat milk , but does not dissolve good in cold water - which is not a problem for hot coffee . You will have to play with the ratios - I would not do just the heavy cream , it made the coffee too rich . Also , I think the powder is too expensive to just use on it\\'s own . I like mixing 1/3 of each together . < br / > < br / > For flavoring , I bough cocoa bean powder , vanilla bean powder , and caster ( superfine ) sugar . I mix up small batches along with spices like cinnamon and nutmeg to make my own flavored creamers . If you wanted , you could use a fake sweetner powder instead . I make up small amounts that I store in jelly canning jars . I also use my little food chopper / food processor to blend everything , so the sugar is not heavier and sinks to the bottom . Let it settle for a bit before opening the top though . < br / > < br / > This stuff tastes WAY better than the storebought creamers and it is fun to experiment and come up with your own flavors . I am going to try using some essential oils next and see if I can get a good chocolate / orange mix . < br / > < br / > All of the ingredients I mentioned are here online . Take the time to experiment . Maybe you don\\'t use any low-fat milk . Or don\\'t add any flavorings . It is up to you . Also , would make great housewarming / host ( ess ) gifts . < br / > < br / > I am sure other molecular people will be able to tell you more of what you can do with it , and I am sure I will experiment with it in cooking - but the main reason I bought it was to make my own creamer and it worked out great . While my dogs like all of the flavors that we have tried of this dog food , for some reason their itching increased when I tried the lamb and rice . I have some very itchy dogs and am giving them a limited ingredient dog food to try to help . The duck and sweet potato cut down on the itching significantly , but when we tried lamb and rice they started itching more once again . I like Natural Balance for the quality ingredients . Awesome dog food . However , when given to my \" Boston \" , who has severe reactions to some food ingredients ; his itching increased to violent jumping out of bed at night , scratching . As soon as I changed to a different formula , the scratching stopped . So glad Natural Balance has other choices . I guess you have to try each , until you find what\\'s best for your pet . We have three dogs and all of them love this food ! We bought it specifically for one of our dogs who has food allergies and it works great for him , no more hot spots or tummy problems . < br / > I LOVE that it ships right to our door with free shipping . My dog has a ton of allergies both environmental and food . She was on a prescription dog food before we had her tested to see what allergies she has . After we got the test back , we learned she was allergic to something in the prescription brand . So I finally found this dog food and she has done so well on this ! She still has her environmental triggers , but I am happy she can finally eat something I know won\\'t cause her pain . My shepherd / collie mix has IBS . Our vet recommended a limited ingredient food . This has really helped her symptoms and she likes it . I will always buy it from Amazon ... it\\'s $ 10 cheaper and free shipping ! Natural Balance Dry Dog Food Lamb Meal and Brown Rice Recipe did wonders for my Jack Russell . She has awful food allergy\\'s and this food was our last hope because it was the last food we could find that didn\\'t have SOMETHING in it that she was allergic to . She has no problem eating it dry but normally I mix the Natural Balance Dry Lamb and Brown Rice with the Natural Balance Wet Lamb and Brown Rice .. she seems to like that better . We started feeding it to our other dog ( a Bichon ) too and she loves it . If your dog has allergy\\'s or stomach issue .. or if you want your dog to eat better food - - this is it ! You will see a difference in your pet . Great food ! I love the idea of one food for all ages & breeds . Ã \\x8e t\\'s a real convenience as well as a really good product . My 3 dogs eat less , have almost no gas , their poop is regular and a perfect consistency , what else can a mom ask for ! ! I have a standard poodle and pomeranian who both do wonderful on this food . I have switched them to a different food ( due to price ) a couple of times and end up going right back to natural balance . This is great dog food , my dog has severs allergies and this brand is the only one that we can feed him . This food is great - all ages dogs . I have a 3 year old and a puppy . They are both so soft and hardly ever get sick . The food is good especially when you have Amazon Prime shipping :) My golden retriever is one of the most picky dogs I\\'ve ever met . After experimenting with various types of food , I have found she loves natural balance . What I really like about natural balance is the fact that it has multiple flavors in dry and wet varieties . I mix her dry food with a little wet food and my golden loves it . Furthermore , I do like mixing up the flavors each time as I think the same meal day over day might get a little boring , so I figured why not . I tend to stay away from the fish type though as it smells ... < br / > < br / > Additionally , I started purchasing off Amazon because Petco didn\\'t have the wet food box and only had a couple of cans . I came home and to my surprise realized that I could save $ 20 each time I bought dog food if I just buy it off Amazon . < br / > < br / > All in all , I definitely recommend and give my stamp of approval to natural balance dog food . While I have never eaten it , my dog seems to love it . This is the same food we get at pet store . But it\\'s delivered to my door ! And for the same price or slightly less . I\\'ve been very pleased with the Natural Balance dog food . Our dogs have had issues with other dog foods in the past and I had someone recommend Natural Balance grain free since it is possible they were allergic to grains . Since switching I haven\\'t had any issues . It is also helpful that have have different kibble size for larger / smaller sized dogs . My 1-1 / 2 year old basenji / jack russell mix loves this dog food . He\\'s been noticeably healthier and more energetic since I switched him over from the standard dog foods earlier this year . Despite the higher cost of natural dog foods , I find that he eats significantly less of the Natural Balance dog foods and still stays happy and full . On the normal dog foods , he\\'d eat up to 3 cups of dog food a day ( the recommended serving for his size ) , whereas he only eats about 1 cup to 1-1 / 2 cup of the Natural Balance dog food a day . When you take this into account , you\\'re actually getting more \" bang for your buck \" with the natural dog foods since you don\\'t have to buy as much to last just as long as the normal dog foods ... and a healthier , happier dog , to boot ! Add in the fact that you can get free , 2 - day shipping with Amazon Prime ... I\\'m sold ! ! Our pup has experienced allergies in forms of hotspots and itching from other dog foods . The cheap \\' you can buy it anywhere \\' food not only have crazy preservatives in them but can cause health problems for your pets . This food works wonders on reducing allergies and our dog loves the food . < br / > This message is RAMSEY FrAnkenSteiN approved . My English Bulldog had skin allergies the summer we got him at age 3 . The vet recommended we wean him off the food his previous owner gave him ( Iams Lamb and Rice ) and onto a new kind . This was the second one we tried , and it has been working ever since . It\\'s for dogs that need a limited diet who can be sensitive to additives and proteins commonly found in commercial dog food ( like chicken or beef ) . I fed this to my Golden Retriever and he hated it . He wouldn\\'t eat it , and when he did , it gave him terrible diarrhea . We will not be buying this again . It\\'s also super expensive . The mouth says , \" How do I love thee , let me count the ways ... \" < br / > If you like apple products a must have item . The only draw back , shipping cost . These are very heavy . Arrived slightly thawed . My parents wouldn\\'t accept it . However , the company was very helpful and issued a full refund . The crust on these tarts are perfect . My husband loves these , but I\\'m not so crazy about them . They are just too sour / tart for my taste . I\\'ll eat the crust and hubby takes my filling . My kids think they\\'re great , so maybe it\\'s just me . These are absolutely scrumptuous ! My husband and I both love them , however , as another customer put it , they are expensive to ship ! The cost of shipping is more than the tartlets themselves are ! What a nice alternative to an apple pie . Love the fact there was no slicing and dicing . Easy to prepare . I also loved the fact that you can make them fresh whenever needed . I like Creme Brulee . I loved that these were so easy . Just sprinkle on the sugar that came with and broil . They look amazing and taste great . My guess thought I really went out of the way for them when really it took all of 5 minutes . I will be ordering more ! not what I was expecting in terms of the company\\'s reputation for excellent home delivery products I first bought pickled asparagus at an Amish market and it was love at first bite . Hence , when I saw these on the discount rack at the local Safeway I cleaned it out . These are even better than the ones from the Amish market . They are fantastic , and some of the jars have a bonus clove of garlic at the bottom . I\\'m going to order the six pack and I\\'m a household of one . They wont go to waste ! I love asparagus . Up until very recently , I had never had pickled asparagus . Oh my goodness , when a friend introduced me to this exact brand , I couldn\\'t believe how great stuff tasted . I loved it so much I bought the six pack . I\\'ve got 2 jars left . Gonna need more ! ! I\\'m presently on a diet and I was at my Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Grocery looking over possible diet foods . I wanted things that were tasty , non-fat and low in calories . I came home with about a dozen items . That\\'s how I discovered the Tillen Farms Pickled Crispy Asparagus . Well , I\\'ve always liked asparagus anyway and I\\'ve enjoyed several brands of pickled asparagus . This Tillen Farms brand is really , really good ! It\\'s the best I can recall . There\\'s an excellent flavor and a big clove of garlic down in the bottom of the jar which I\\'m looking forward to eating . I can\\'t believe how good this asparagus tastes and right on the front it says \" only 60 calories per jar ! \" Now this is my idea of a good diet food ! < br / > < br / > Gary Peterson I was diappointed in the flavor and texture of this mix . I usually like most of the Low Carb things I have tried , but was diappointed in this specific one . I have been drinking this tea for a long time now . I used to have to purchase it at a doctor\\'s office because it wasn\\'t available elsewhere . I\\'m so glad that I can buy it now from Amazon.com . I drink this tea throughout the day like other folks drink coffee . Wonderful taste . I have been drinking Royal King 100 % Natural Organic Green Tea ( 100 tea bags x 2g each ) as my every day tea for several years now . I buy 12 boxes at a time to save on shipping . For many years I used to drink coffee from morning till night . But finally I realized that drinking so much coffee was not healthy for me . I finally resolved to improve my health and stopped drinking coffee all together . I tried many alternative drinks to replace my coffee habit . I found that green tea was not only good tasting it also has health benefits . Green tea is one of the few drinks that actually makes you healthier ( coffe and other drinks do not ) - the only healthier drink is quality cold water . In my opinion , for the price , Royal King 100 % Natural Organic Green Tea is one of the best tasting teas . This green tea has a beautiful golden color , the taste is bright and fresh . I recommend adding a tiny amount of Y . S . Organic Bee Farms RAW HONEY to the tea to add sweetness and health benefits too . I also give myself a treat once in a while by having a much more expense tea ( Tribute Xi Hu Long Jing ) but this fantastic tea is not practical for me to drink as my every day tea ( although I would if I could afford it ) . < br / > < br / > Cons : On my latest shipment the package shown on the Amazon page is different than the one shipped . The one shipped displays \" NATURALLY HIGH IN POLYPHENOL CATECHINS \" ( a key contributive element to the possible health effects of tea ) , whereas the Amazon package displays \" CAFFENE FREE \" . So I am not sure if this green tea is Caffene free or not . The other con is that sometimes the tea bag rips open when I unwrap the string from around the tea bag . So if the string seems stuck to the tea bag I put the bag in the hot water to unstick it . this has to be one of the best teas I have ever tasted ... it\\'s clean , bright , fresh ... < br / > < br / > great delivery ... again quality ... just try it ... I love , love this green tea . It is very hard to find in our area and some places on the internet charge a big price and I usually don\\'t get as many boxes as I did with this merchant . I will definitely order from this seller again ! ! Thanks ! ! I depend on my green tea fix everyday ! I love this tea . It helps curb my eating during the day . My Mom and I have given it all friends to try . I\\'m Italian and I lived in Italy for years . I used to buy these cookies for my everyday breakfast with an Italian espresso . I couldn\\'t find them anywhere here in the Bay area , so it\\'s great to have them again . In the 1980s I spent several summers in Italy . This biscotti is often given as a breakfast food or mid-day snack . They are simple and delicious and were not sold in the US back then . They are so good that I brought back two bags from a recent trip to Italy . It is great to see that they may now be found on Amazon ! < br / > < br / > Note : it is great to open a bag , smell the contents , pour a glass of milk , then dip the Macines in the milk . Great routine and treat for kids ! I had heard a little about this product from the local pet store , then tried a small bag for our 2 cats of about 3 and 6 years respectively . The female , younger one took to it right away , and the older male , who was unfortunately weaned on the junk cat food with all the corn meal and etc ... in it , and would usually refuse a diet change , actually liked it too . The older male is overweight and we were trying to switch him to soft food on the doctor\\'s request , but he totally refused it . He is a posh cat after all . He still consumes too many calories , the fatty , but at least I know he\\'s eating good food . Of course , I know this product seems to cost more than most other feline food on the market , but I just can\\'t see feeding our animals the lousy alternatives that are out there , marketed as being healthy . Why do commercials show cats eating a vegetarian diet which is mostly corn meal ? Is that right ? I\\'ll stay with this for now , but stay tuned . < br / > < br / > I\\'m updating this review after 9 months of using this cat food for our two cats . I upgraded the stars from 4 to 5 as it really has been a good food for the two of them . Garfield still eats a little too much , but he\\'s just a big cat who doesn\\'t exercise much , let\\'s face it . Our female cat will be 4 years old in a couple months and she\\'s so healthy . She\\'s tiny , but happy and agile . I tried the chicken version of Holistic Select , but Garfield seemd to miss this sardine version so we went back to this one . I\\'ve ordered the duck version and will update this once they try it . I started buying this after I noticed my 1 year old cat was already starting to lose his \" spunk \" so I decided it was time to start buying him \" real \" cat food ... not the garbage in the super markets . I found this at the pet store out of the other million choices , and I\\'m sure there are other brands that are just as good but this is the one I went with to try first and it was a great purchase . My cat has been on this for the past 8 months and he\\'s now just has active as he was when he was a kitten and his coat has became sooo soft . Mainly , he loved the taste even more ! I highly recommend this brand to all my friends and family for their animals ! I have done a lot of research to find the best food for my cat , and this is an excellent food . That is also according to my holistic veterinarian . They put probiotics on the kibble as the last step , which is very important to me . The best thing is that my cat loved it immediately and I had to stop mixing it with the old food because she only would eat Holistic Select . This cat food was recommended by my vet because my 13 year old Cleo Cat was having trouble keeping any food down and was loosing weight . It stopped her problems . She doesn\\'t eat as much as before since she seems to be more satisfied after eating which helps justify the added price . It aids in digestion since the ... ok sorry ... smells are gone if ya know what I mean . Had to add that so anyone experiencing problems with their cats can see there are a lot of benifits from this cat food . I have a 4 year old male cat who has chronic urinary tract infections . I feed him this dry food in combination with wet food ( with water added to it ) and Uri Ease . The combination seems to keeps his UTI\\'s under control . If I switch to another type of dry food , his UTI gets worse . The other cats seem to enjoy this food as well . It\\'s expensive but it seems to be the best solution for me . Before I was educated about feline nutrition , I allowed my cats to become addicted to dry cat food . I always offered both canned and dry , but wish I would have fed them premium quality canned food and limited dry food . I have two 15 year old cats and two 5 year old cats . The only good quality dry foods they will eat are Wellness and Innova . Innova\\'s manufacturer was recently purchased by Procter & Gamble . I began looking for a replacement . After once again offering several samples ( from my local holistic pet store ) Holistic Select was the only one ( other than the usual Wellness and Innova ) they would eat . For finicky cats , I recommend trying Holistic Select . It is a good quality food that is very palatable for finicky eaters . My holistic vet recommended this , along with a few other brands . We tried them all , but my cats prefer this ( especially the sardine version ) . The best part is their coats are so soft and clean and their eyes are so clear . AND ( and I don\\'t want to be rude , so I\\'ll say this as delicately as I can ) their waste is far less odorous than cats who eat the McDonalds junk found in most stores , which is a definite plus for me ! The health benefits are so obvious - I highly recommend Holistic Select ! One of my cats is allergic to fish and beef . This formula is one of the few she can eat , and it has much better ingredients than the prescription diets available at the vet . Both of my kitties are very active , have soft shiny fur , and neither are fat . Dry food reduces tartar buildup on teeth , also . Our cats thrive extremely well on this dry cat food . They definitely have much less hair ball throw ups and their fur is great . They are fit and not over weight . This vendor ships extremely fast . Is one of the top Amazon suppliers in our book ! I\\'ve been a fan of Hot & Spicy Maruchan Ramen for a long time . If you enjoy spice , and love ramen , you\\'ll love this product . Too bad it\\'s way too expensive here on Amazon . It\\'s only $ 3.36 per 12 at my Walmart . I\\'ve been eating Ramen noodles since I was a little kid , and I\\'ve never found a better flavor than Hot & Spicy Chicken ! It isn\\'t hot at all to a chilihead like me , but it sure is good ! I LOVE spicy ramen , but for whatever reasons this thing burns my stomach badly and the burning sensation doesn\\'t go away for like 3 hours ! Not sure if that is healthy or not ... and you can buy this at Walmart for $ 0.28 , way cheaper than Amazon . Always being a fan of ramen as a quick and easy meal , finding it on amazon for a decent price and having it delivered to your door by the case is an amazing situation for anyone to find themselves in . I must be a bit of a wuss , because this soup tastes to me how I imagine fire might taste . Typically I like spicy food if it has a good flavor . I don\\'t find this to be the case with this soup . Any flavor is killed off by the burn . I really loved the spicy flavor these had . I found myself liking the broth more than the noodles which is usually the opposite . If you aren\\'t used to the heat this might bother you and if you like hot hot foods this might not be enough . Got these on sale for roughly 25 cents per cup , which is half the price of my local grocery stores , plus they rarely stock the spicy flavors . These things are a GREAT snack for my office where time is constantly crunched and sometimes you can\\'t escape for a real meal . This is one of my favorite flavors of Instant Lunch and will be back to buy every time it goes on sale . i have bought allot of different flavors and this happens to be one of my favorites and will be getting more soon I love this flavor of ramen ! I don\\'t eat other flavors anymore because they taste too bland by comparison . For the convenience of having it delivered to my home ( I have prime , so I get it in two days and don\\'t have to pay for the shipping ) , the price on amazon isn\\'t bad at all , but it is still cheaper to run down and pick up a case of this at the grocery store . The BEST investment I\\'ve ever made for ginger . It\\'s unbelievable ! It\\'s fibrous like the real ginger , has that spicy kick to it , but it\\'s perfect with the sugar - calms it down . It\\'s very worth the $ 40 for 5lbs of it ! I\\'ll be getting more soon - I use these as a topper for my ginger cupcakes and cookies :) Delicious . I cannot get Australian ginger where I live . This compares favorably to Australian Ginger I\\'ve purchased in other cities . Now I can enjoy it without traveling . I keep trying other brands ... cheaper brands . Stupid me ! This ginger IS soooo worth the money . Tender , moist and never a let down . My son has had acid reflux since birth and has been on every medication available with no improvement , Until an older gentleman came into his work place and told him about this product and I automatically ordered it for him . I was really not expecting any better results than the 1000 other things we have tried . What a surprise ! He has not had any heartburn or symptoms since day 2 of starting eating one piece of this Ginger each morning . He can now eat anything and actually enjoy it . This product was a God send for him . Thank you all for it ! I bought this for our office to give people something sweet to snack on . Because it\\'s bite size it\\'s easier for people to grab a couple a pieces rather than an entire licorice stick . My only complaint is that one of the bags broke open in shipping . Twizzlers brand licorice is much better than that other well known brand . < br / > If you can get these for $ 2 to $ 2.50 a package with free s / h it\\'s a good deal . < br / > The black and cherry have good taste ; but the strawberry taste was too delicate and barely there I love these ... very tasty ! ! ! Infact , I think I am addicted to them . < br / > Buying them in packs of 6 bags - is very reasonable than going to Target and getting a bag . Savings are about a $ 1.00 a bag . I use subscribe and save on these and several other product . I love subscribe and save ! ! ! If you are looking for a less messy version of licorice for the children , then be sure to try these ! They\\'re soft , easy to chew , and they don\\'t get your hands all sticky and gross in the car , in the summer , at the beach , etc . We love all the flavos and sometimes mix these in with the chocolate to have a very nice snack ! Great item , great price too , highly recommend ! I might be mistaken , but it appears that the pieces in this bag were reduced in size . If they did do that , it was doubtlessly done to make it appear that the buyer got a better deal , having so many pieces after all . The problem is that the pieces have to be a certain size in order to have enough flavor for your eating experience . As it is , you have to use 2 or 3 pieces to match the old piece size ; it is not the same . Being a fan of Newman\\'s Pineapple salsa for quite a while , I was looking for a comparable salsa . This is one of the best tasting salsas I\\'ve ever had . My daughters love it too . They don\\'t like super chunky salsa and the Berry Mango has a nice smooth texture with small mango pieces . The salsa is not too sweet , just sweet enough and although it\\'s mild , it has a nice little kick to it . At this price , it\\'s a steal ! The SALSA smelled delicious , as I think it probably was - but , unfortunately , the person , at AMAZON , that is a packer ( there is probably several ) had very little \" stuffing \" to work with , especially on the bottoms . Therefore , the bottoms were broken on all three bottles . As I reached for my computer ; I was told NO RETURNS ( cause it\\'s a food item ) . I then looked for a CUSTOMER SERVICE tag ; and I found \" none \" on their NEW FACE LIFT . THEY SEEM TO BE PROUD OF THEIR NEW FACE LIFT BUT ... THEY SHOULD AT LEAST HAVE A PLACE TO CONTACT THEM IN EMERGENCIES ! LIKE : I BUY A LOT OF \" STUFF \" AND IT ALL COMES IN STYROFOAM BOXES . NEVER WOULD I SHIP THINGS < br / > ESPECIALLY SALSA - IN A CARDBOARD BOX WITH JUST A STRIPE OF LARGE BUBBLE WRAP ON IT . NO MATTER HOW MUCH THE CARRIER ( FED EX ) IS CAREFUL , IT\\'S GOING TO BREAK SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE . ESPECIALLY IN AN ALL GLASS CONTAINER ! BARBARA L . S . This is one of the best salsas that I have found in a long time but stay away from the variety pack . The other two that come with it are not worth your money . These remind me of dog treats I made once using pumpkin and cinnamon . They\\'re kind of bland and not my favorite Back To Nature product . But my finace really loves them so that\\'s where the three stars come from . This is the best cornmeal . I made regular cornbread and hot water cornbread with this meal and both were outstanding . Also fried some oysters with this meal , it gave them a great texture and flovor . This is a fabulous marinade ! I love to use it for chicken , either baked in the oven OR on the grill . This has enough flavor & flair , I\\'ve even used it for dinner parties , only to receive rave reviews from my guests ! ! DEFINITELY worth the price ! Super cheap and super easy ! Love it ! Works with chicken fish beef or pork . Fast easy and makes it taste excellent . Plus buying in bulk is more than 50 % off from box stores Got this for my brother who is on Jorge Cruise diet and decided to try one for myself . It actually tastes pretty good . These singles sell for $ 2.50 - $ 3.36 at the store for 1 box of 24 singles . I\\'m not sure why Amazon is selling it for $ 9.99 for a box of 24 singles . Hazelnut coffee creamer is my favorite , but truly this is not a good buy . AWESOME ! ! ! such a yummy flavor I got it as a healthy alternative to the desserts we normally eat and I am so glad that I did there are so many things you can do with Jello desserts and still have them taste good and be good for you . I will definitentally be purchasing this product again the flavor was so wonderful . I went to 4 grocery stores looking for this flavor of Jello for my green tomato jam recipe and finally found it here . This jello is wonderful ! Evidently it\\'s only carried in the stores during the summer but with harvest time in the Fall , I couldn\\'t find it anywhere in town . This Jello tastes like watermelon and the jam recipe I made with it takes like watermelon jam ! Great made as regular Jello too . Yummy ! What a deal this is the healthiest salt you can use . This box should last our family the year no problem . Iodized sea salt will not raise your blood pressure as regular salt will . Perfect size sea salt for the table or the picnic basket . We love it . Shakes well , no clumping and flows freely . < span class = \" tiny \" > Length :: 0:26 Mins < br / > < br / > </span> The expiration date is 21 months from the day I bought this product . The tuna , tomato combination is delicious . This is one of the many items I re-order on Amazon every month or so . < br / > edit : added a short video , so you see what this combination looks like . < br / > < br / > I was wearing one of those headlamps , but I didn\\'t do a good job focusing on the tuna . < br / > I should film it over , but it doesn\\'t look like many people view this product anyway . I\\'ve never heard of the SAFCOL brand before but I was tired of only trying the typical pouches ; Starkist and Chicken of the Sea . I was really surprised as I thought it was a bit better than the other brands and with less seasoning . these are the best tasting tuna pack they make in my opinion - make a great on the go snack , and really satisfying with the tomato I have always purchased Star-Kist tuna but thought I would try this brand for a change of pace . The taste of the tuna was not pleasant , too much basil and other spices for me . I\\'m not familiar with the Safcol brand but being a tuna addict , gave this a shot . The tuna tastes like it\\'s good quality but I found the tomato basil flavor to be a bit bland . It\\'s better than something plain but it didn\\'t pack the punch I was hoping for . It\\'s still a great option for a low calorie , low fat meal . I found it much tastier than the plain tuna pouches out there . Excellent quality , and no need to \\' dress it up \\' . < br / > < br / > I put it the micro on about 20 % power for 1 minute and Shazam ! < br / > < br / > I believe a little heating brings out the flavor . Seriously this product was as tasteless as they come . There are much better tasting products out there but at 100 calories its better than a special k bar or cookie snack pack . You just have to season it or combine it with something else to share the flavor . I read about pomegranate molasses so I had to try it ! I haven\\'t made anything with it yet , just eaten a little bit at a time but WOW is it decadent ! It\\'s dark , syrupy , sour , and a little sweet . A dab of this and I forget about dessert . It\\'s just a really unique flavor with a pleasing metallic undertone . Yum ! ! I\\'m going to try making fesenjan next :-) Used this in Moroccan recipes , as a syrup in a brilliant mixed beverage and as a swirled topping on sliced oranges soaked in orange water . Wonderful , wonderful stuff ! I don\\'t know how long these sat on the back of a shelf somewhere , but they were so old that they wouldn\\'t cook . I had to throw half of them out , because the skins were damaged , a clear sign of dried beans past their prime . I can\\'t even return these or ask for a refund , because food is not returnable . Will find a different brand to use . For now , I have about fifty servings of beans to throw away . Besides being smaller than runts , they look the same and have the same consistency . Unfortunately , they taste nothing like banana runts ... nor do they even taste good . Yucky stuff . Trying to return with vendor . The item over all was fine , but the Banana Heads are not just like Banana Runts they are alot smaller . Also when I received the item , the packaging was not great . The Banana Heads had come open during shipping and were all over the packing envelope . I purchased as a giveaway for a baby shower with Jungle theme ! They worked out perfect for 25 small bags of candy . I purchased 5 # . If you want more than 25 small bags , I would purchase a larger bag . I have drunk Ricore since my mother allowed be to drink caffeine . I love this stuff in milk . < br / > It\\'s much smoother and tastier than instant coffee with milk . I am French and live in the US , < br / > and bring back boxes of Ricore at every opportunity . Savora is another hidden gem you can bring < br / > back . Check it out . I first had this drink when my mother brought it back with her from a visit to her home in Brittany France and thought it was delicious ! I wish it were a bit cheaper but other than that , I love this product ! I couldn\\'t wait to try the 8 ″ Cinnamon Coffee Cake because it is made with fresh eggs , creamy sour cream , Madagascar Bourbon Vanilla and is topped and filled with cinnamon streusel . This 8 ″ Cinnamon Coffee Cake is available online for only $ 18.95 . Now , I have had my fair share of cinnamon coffee cakes , but , let me just tell you that the FantasiCakes Cinnamon Coffee Cake really \" takes the cake \" with size , price , quality and taste . < br / > The cake arrived very fast and was carefully packaged so that it arrived in almost perfect condition . It also comes with a large tub of white icing that you can drizzle over the top , before serving . I couldn\\'t believe how large the size was and it actually fed my family of 5 for us to enjoy during breakfast , for three days . The cake itself is thick and almost has a solid but sponge cake type consistency that is really moist and very filling . The flavors are to die for with the sticky cinnamon outside and sweet cinnamon and vanilla swirled throughout the inside of the cake . The icing really tops it off beautifully and gives it that moist and sticky sweet flavor . Pair the cake with your morning coffee and you\\'ve got the perfect breakfast treat ! I used to love these growing up and stopped drinking water and lemon juice from this brand about 5-6 years ago . This stuff used to be so strong i used to just pour some in my mouth and get that alive feeling going . It feels like the product went through changes which added more water or something to make it not so strong . The stronger it is the less you use as well . The product is still really good but the taste is the same quality as the cheaper brand names almost . I thought these would go fast but hey all lemon stuff i love unless it goes bad . This is a good product just wish it still had that hit me in the mouth chug sensation it used to be like . One of the best lemon juice that I have tried . I am recurring customer due to the high quality of this product . When the season for fresh lemos is out , this one supplement our need for the citrus on the kitchen or refreshments . < br / > < br / > I will continue buying it . This lemon juice is a must in my kitchen year-round . It has a powerful flavor and you don\\'t need much of it to zest up a dish . I add a spritz of it to my water nearly every day . < br / > < br / > I will buy this product again and again . Fast delivery and good product . This is the same lemon juice concentrate you can find in stores and it\\'s really handy to have around to add to sauces , dressings , etc . Such a pain to squeeze fresh juice everytime you need it , nevermind having the lemons on hand to begin with . This is not as good as the Frozen Lemon juice , but it is good . It has a slightly odd flavor , perhaps from a preservative . Sure wish I could order the frozen juice ! Couldn\\'t believe it when told how relaxing this beverage was . Seriously , drink it only if you are getting ready for a nap or bedtime . If you have plans to drive or perform any other activity not recommended . < br / > < br / > I feel my arms and legs almost tingle with relaxation . After a short time my eyes start to get droopy and I am in another place . < br / > < br / > Love this stuff . I bought these at Grocery Outlet here in the Seattle Tacoma are for $ 4.00 a case of tweleve not paying $ 38.00 Yes 3 for a dollar . I like the taste not great but not bad either low calorie will buy more but not at this whacked out price . This is an great product . The taste is great , and it works exactly as described . Superb natural sleep aid . AMAZING ! WE have been looking for \" natural \" ways to help us sleep since we always seem to be overloaded with stress and a busy schedule . Yes , we\\'d probably be better served taking a yoga class , but this is a good second choice . This helps you fall asleep and stay asleep . I drank half the first night and that was plenty for me . After about 30 minutes , I was ready for bed ! I woke up refreshed and with no sleepy-drug hangover , so that is a huge bonus . < br / > < br / > I gave the product 3 stars ( instead of the 5 it deserves ) as their packing job was marginal at best . The product arrived with 2 broken bottles , which at this price is a $ 6 loss ! The bottles are glass and all they did was wrap one layer of the small-bubbled bubble wrap around the case and placed it in a larger box with extra room to move around in that box . Big packing fail , but the product is awesome . We made chocolate chip cookies with BRM Garbanzo Bean Flour and the results were fantastic ! The brown sugar and chocolate mask any bean taste that other reviews have mentioned . Our friends couldn\\'t discern any difference from classic CCCs . The texture , body , and elasticity ( meaning reduced tendency to fall apart that occurs with most other gluten-free flours ) is nice and chewy - - the same as CCCs made with regular flour . And an added bonus - - the high protein and fiber level ( I calculate 2-3 g fiber / cookie ) fills you up so that you are satisfied with smaller servings and the glycemic index is significantly lower . < br / > < br / > I highly recommend this flour even if CCCs are the only thing you make with it . This is great stuff . Made some really tasty banana bread . Good quality and lowest price in town . We had trouble finding this locally - delivery was fast , no more hunting up and down the flour aisle at our local grocery stores . This packet of glaze is the secret to making those European style fresh fruit tarts . I am about to make one for a pie auction at church , after a friend requested that something \" strawberry \" should be offered . You can make the most amazing and relatively \" healthy \" fruit tarts by baking a base , layering it with uncooked , fresh , sliced fruit , then pouring over the made-up contents of one of these packets . They harden up at room temperature , hold the fruit together so you can slice the tart , and they let the beauty of the arranged fruit show through . I\\'ve also seen this glaze used over cheesecakes , to hold a fruit topping in place . Personally , I do not like cheesecake ( too rich for me ) but a fruit glazed cheesecake is gorgeous , I will admit . To do this , slice fruit and layer it on the cheesecake while it\\'s still in the springform pan . Pour on the glaze , let it set up and then remove the springform . You\\'ll have a clear layer of fruit on top of the cheesecake . Cherries , strawberries or sliced mangos are nice , but the best one I ever had used thin slices of lemons , that had been gently poached in sugar syrup before they were layered on the cake . < br / > < br / > I use a base of sponge cake , baked in a shallow form , but other bases can be pate sucre ( a kind of French pastry that is a bit like a sugar cookie ) that works well in those fluted , straight-sided forms . You can also make mini-tarts in a muffin pan , pre-baking each mold with a layer of pie crust ( even commercial crust works , though again , I prefer pate sucre , it holds its shape better and is more substantial and has a better crumb . ) Just blind-bake the muffin tins lined with pate , then pop them out and fill with fresh fruits ( berries are great ) and pour over the glaze . Some people put a layer of creme patisserie , which is a pastry cream like custard but stabilized with flour , below the fruit and I happen to think these taste best . < br / > < br / > If you get into baking , this glaze is a must-have on the shelf . The ingredients are vegan : tapioca starch , carrageenan , dextrose , cream of tartar , locust bean gum , so if you are looking to make a vegan tofu cheesecake , you can use this on top , as well as use it for fruit tarts with a nut crust base . My Scotties were full of hot spots and when I used this within a week all the hot spots were gone . The smell is kinda strong , but not bad . It\\'s tolerablel . I bought this coffee because its much cheaper than the ganocafe and has the organic reishi mushroom as well as other healthy antioxidants . I didn\\'t expect it to taste good , but it actually does ! I\\'ve only had it for a few days and for $ 5 its totally worth it . My sisters all take ganocafe but now I\\'m introducing them to this less expensive similar coffee . I will follow up on this product in a few weeks . :) The coffee is very finely processed and the flavor is just alright . Nescafe and Mount Hagen are better - I bought this to try something other than these two , but I probably won\\'t get this again . There is just a slight \" vitaminy \" taste , but it\\'s not overwhelming . It\\'s also a bit pricey for what you get . This coffee is great because it\\'s all organic ingredients ! No pesticides to worry about , plus it tastes good , and you have the healing effects for ganoderma . Like the other people mentioned , this coffee has a great taste . I\\'ve tried different instant coffees before , but this one is one of the better ones . Another one of my favorites , if you want to try it out ( though NOT organic ) , is \\' Africafe pure instant coffee \\' Tastes great , and gives me energy without the jitters . Love this product . < br / > However , I do wish it came in some sort of resealable jar or hard plastic container instead of a zip-lock pouch because the zip-lock ripped off and quit working after awhile . But the product is fantastic , just not crazy about the packaging . These little guys are tasty and refreshing . < br / > < br / > I usually eat salads for lunch which can do terrible things to breath . I eat 2 of these after lunch ( because they are so small ) and I find this sufficiently resolves the problem . < br / > < br / > They\\'re sugar free ( sugar can actually help the smelly bacteria grow ) which is great and they\\'re tasty enough that I almost think of them as part of my lunch . < br / > < br / > This is a good bulk value buy and I\\'d highly recommend the mints themselves . Cheers ! I like these better than the regular Altoids , but they\\'re even more costly , so you\\'d better like them . These little tins of sugar free mine mints were a great deal.There perfict for on the go.Fifty mints per tin is just the right amount to cary along.And there safer for your teeth than the ones with sugar.The price of twelve dollars was very resonable.Also there great for shareing.If you are looking for a mint try these ones.Youll be glad you did . Pros : < br / > + packaging , shipping , price < br / > + sold about a year before its expiration date ( enough for me to eat / share 9 boxes ) < br / > + not too \" fresh \" like the regular wintergreen and not in a powdery form . it\\'s a real mint ! < br / > < br / > Cons : none ! Be careful not to eat too many of them in one day , as one of the chemicals in it is the same as that of a LAXATIVE ! ! ! LOLOLOL ! ! ! These mints are really strong and have a great taste . They are also a convenient size to carry in a pocket or purse . This is a huge supply of them . I\\'m still working on these and have plenty to spare . Much more effective than buying one from the grocery store or 7-11 every time you want a mint . Even with small containers , they don\\'t fill them up . These little tins are less than half filled and at the price charged it seems a rip-off . Is there some exotic ingredient as costly as gold contained in those tiny squares ? Or how about the cereal ploy , they were filled at the factory but settled in transport . < br / > Can manufacturers be honest in their dealings ? I love , and use the empty containers for medicine / advil in my purse , desk , suitcase . Also line with felt to keep earrings . Perfect little size to disguise small valuables when traveling and LOVE the mints . Tiny and powerful without burning my mouth . Received as shown . My mother in law likes these and Walgreens quit carrying them . It was great i could get them on Amazon . I keep a case of these in my office and always have at least a tin or two on my desk for visitors to help themselves to . Some folks stop by just to grab some mints and others pop them like candy while we meet . When I find someone who keeps coming back for more I just give them their own tin ! One co-worker asked me to save the tins for her so she could use them as pillboxes and safety pin boxes . Like I said , theyre a real hit . Since I wouldn\\'t be able to keep my hands off a candy dish , this is a good alternative to have around and it\\'s nice to have them around if I have garlic for lunch ! I gave the item 4 stars because they aren\\'t as tasty as the sugar version of the mints but what sugar free item is as good as it\\'s full sugar counterpart ? ) and because of the fact that each tin is wrapped in plastic which seems like a waste and is irritating to remove ( although I totally get why they wrap it - it still doesn\\'t make it easy to deal with ) . The tiny Altoids are great for a quick breath freshening and the small box is great for portability . It\\'s full , but compact . < br / > < br / > I haven\\'t run out yet , and probably won\\'t for a couple months , but I can\\'t wait to buy it again . I loved these Wintergreen Altoid Smalls so much , I had to come write a review . The packaging is small for convenience , and the Altoids are smaller as well with a square shape , blue hue , and even more delicious taste in my opinion . I definitely prefer them over the regular-size Altoids and will continue purchasing them ! Highly recommended ! Fresh scent and taste . Easy to eat one tin in few hours . I use them as favors and everyone loved them . Hard to find the wintergreen smalls [ sugar free ] as stores only have the red smalls [ peppermint - - such a common flavor ] . The wintergreen is refreshing and absolutely delicious . Driving cross country , if someone cuts me off , I turn to my daughter with my hand out and say \" Wintergreen Me ! \" She pulls one out , puts it in my hand , and all is right with the world . To me , these are nothing like the regular Altoids and are not breath mints . They are pleasant-tasting little candies in a cute convenient tin , and that\\'s as far as it goes . The mintiness is just not strong , and the wintergreens are definitely weaker than the peppermint minis . I\\'m not a dragon-breath person , but still , one of these mints is too small to have any effect on my breath . Four or five will freshen my breath for a short while - maybe 15 minutes . At this point , I think the Icebreakers Frost mints are the best as sugar free breath mints . we have fed our cats a lot of stuff . These 2 boy cats are not picky eaters . They loved the Purina . They loved the Nutro . They loved the Iams . They love whatever we feed them . < br / > < br / > This review is based on what we , their affectionate owners love . After a certain age , we were instructed by the vet to consider senior foods - and lower carb foods , because the catties were fatties . We tried a few types of food . Some evinced no change . Some made the litter super-stink . Some had too small a kibble and the cats barfed it up because they didn\\'t have to chew it to swallow it ... < br / > < br / > This Felidae has done the trick . No problems to speak of . It is consistent in the litter and bearable on the nose . The cats love it . The kibble is sized appropriate to chewing . And here\\'s the kicker : < br / > After feeding the cats Felidae , their demeanor improved . Their coats are super soft and lush - both are new improvements we can directly attribute to this food . We\\'re now loyal Felidae consumers . < br / > < br / > Additionally , the absence of corn product in the feed seems to lessen or remove the reactions of our friends with cat-allergies . I started my cat on Felidae Platinum about 3 weeks ago and she loves it . She\\'s an older cat , somewhat overweight , and had a grouchy temperament . I first mixed it with her previous food and she figured out which was which - - she ate the Felidae and left the old food ! She\\'s now been on just the Felidae for about ten days now , off the old food entirely , and she is a much sweeter , happier cat . I think it must agree with her better or be more easily digested , or something . In any case , I am a happy purchaser of Felidae . I don\\'t agree with the previous reviewer that cats don\\'t like it . Clearly , mine does . We have three cats , the youngest is about eleven years old , another is fifteen and our oldest is , well ancient . That is what the vet told us ten years ago . The youngest is a blob . When he lays down , he looks like a footstool . The other two are arthritic and skinny . < br / > < br / > Since we had such success with Canidae Platinum for senior dogs , I figured that we\\'d give it a try for our cats . I\\'d had them on low ash Purina One Urinary tract formula for their entire lives and thankfully we had no UT problems . < br / > < br / > Buster , the youngest , is still a blob after six months plus on Felidae for Senior and Overweight cats . However , the other two are now much more active and we can tell that they are really \" feeling better \" since we changed their food to Felidae . Even Prissy , the ancient one has started to play and tease the dogs by getting them to chase her , where before when she was on Purina One , all she wanted to do was to sleep . < br / > < br / > I think that if you can get your cat on this fairly early in their weight problems , it\\'ll be more effective . < br / > < br / > However , the glucosamine will certainly help your older fur balls have a happier life . Too much of a good thing ? We worked this kibble in over time , slowly shifting the percentage of Felidae to national junk-food brand until the bowl was all natural . By this time , the cats couldn\\'t keep it in or down . What a mess . We\\'ve moved on . As with canidae , Felidae has also changed their formula . Cats do not like change when it comes to their food . And they just had to change it without putting it on their label . We noticed the color of the food had changed and so did the smell . ( As you will notice I have also reviewd the Canidae , and this all happened the same time the dogs were having issues . ) < br / > < br / > Prior to the change in food we had almost lost two of our cats because we had moved to a new home . If cats get \" upset \" because of a change in enviorment , or a loud noise they can stop eating . It depends on the cat . Two of them had stopped eating and had lost a lot of weight . We took them to the vet and it took months to get them back to normal . It has been a year since then and they are better . Then the formula for this food changed . < br / > < br / > We started to noitce they were not eating as much and it started to bug us . We asked the shop owner of the feed store and she had no knowledge of any change to the food . It wasn\\'t until the we were in there with other customers yelling about their dogs food making their dogs sick . Right away we changed the cats food and they started chowing down and haven\\'t suffered one bit like our dogs have . < br / > < br / > Cats are sensitve animals and changes to thier food could cause them to stop eating . Anyone thinking of purchasing this food should not do it ! We have 5 rescued and fixed cats , none of which are picky eaters and the change in this formula could have been the death of them had we not found out about the change in their formula . < br / > < br / > I urge anyone that has had these problems to go to the consumer affairs website and also the FDA website and write a letter to them to let them know how this has affected your animal . As with canidae they do not care how the change has affected my animals , and tell me not to buy it . This is just horrible ! Don\\'t buy just a few of these ! I order these by the case . I can\\'t even remember the first time I tasted an anchovy stuffed olive but I have tried several of the brands online and this brand is my favorite . I order these olives a lot . They are un-like any other olives out there . The subtle flavors of the brine go great with cheeses . One of my favorite appetizer treats for guests . Hey , the description says 360 grams - that is roughly 13 ounces at under $ 4.00 per can . No way - that is the approximate price for a 100 gram can . My husband and I are both kind of wimpy when it comes to hot things and this seasoning is just a bit too spicy for us . It definitely makes you sweat a bit when you\\'re eating it . It was still edible to us by adding a good sized dollop of sour cream but I don\\'t think I would buy it again due to the heat . We prefer the milder McCormick\\'s brand of Fajita mix . I\\'ve also had fajitas in a couple of different restaurants and it wasn\\'t as spicy as this mix is . < br / > < br / > If you like super spicy then this is not burning hot so you might want to keep that in mind . To me it was more than medium hot but not by too much . < br / > < br / > I gave it three stars because it was pretty easy to make and it\\'s versatile in that you could vary the veggies you put in it . You take a plastic bag , a couple of tbs of vegetable oil , 1/4 cup water and mix the seasoning , water and oil together then add the chicken strips to the bag and let it marinate for 5 minutes . In the meantime , it says to stir fry your veggies ( peppers and onion ) but I found it easier to just cook the chicken and veggies together and I don\\'t think it affected quality or taste . I also used extra virgin olive oil rather than vegetable oil . < br / > < br / > I have one more package of this to use and next time I\\'m going to add more veggies and maybe some chopped tomato to cut the heat a bit more . A friend who\\'d been drinking tea for 80 of his 84 years introduced me to this tea a few months ago . Even took me over to the store and bought me a pound . At $ 7 / lb . in a retail store or a little over $ 9 with shipping from an online merchant , I think it\\'s great . I\\'ve been drinking Earl Grey , English Breakfast , Irish Breakfast , Lapsang Souchong , Assam , etc . Most of them were over $ 30 / lb . with shipping . Aside from the Lapsang Souchong , I think this is a great replacement for all the rest . Has everything I\\'m looking for in a strong , full-bodied black tea with enough character to keep it from becoming boring . My current favorite afternoon tea . Unless you\\'re extremely jaded or a tea snob , you\\'ll love it . I love strong , full bodied quality tea and typically drink assam , irish breakfast or early grey tea , but as the other reviewer noted the price per pound can be discouraging . So I have been searching for a quality full bodied tea that wasn\\'t bitter at a more palatable price point , and this certainly fits the bill . And unlike some other teas where they tend to be better in one form or another , i . e . iced vs . hot , this tea is excellent in both forms . I would certainly recommend this to anyone who prefers that smooth full bodied quality tea that doesn\\'t cost an arm and leg . I drink this tea plain ( without sugar or milk ) , and it has a pleasant aroma . < br / > < br / > The price from Amazon is cheaper than my local grocery store . One reviewer is right , I think it has some herbal smell to make up the aroma . So the label \" Imperial Blend \" kind of implied the herb . < br / > < br / > I am not exactly a black tea drinker , so this tea is a surprise , and affordable too . I usually prefer White Chinese tea , like White Peony , but it is more expensive , and requires lower temperature water . But this is black tea , and this aroma kind of remind me the \\' softness \\' of white tea . I\\'ve tried a variety of Ahmad tea . Not because I particularly like this brand , but they are just easier to come across . The Imperial blend , I believe , is the most complex yet well balanced of all the ones I\\'ve tried . It\\'s full body like a good cup of Assam , which by no means overpower the delightful , clean taste of Darjeerling , complete with a long lasting note of bergamot . I enjoy it best in the evening . It gives a satisfying and relaxing finish to a busy day . < br / > < br / > For those interested in the specifics : I use about 3 teaspoons of lose tea in a stainless steel infuser in a 16 oz mug , let it steep in 208F water for 2-3 min , take the infuser out , and drink it without sugar or milk to savor its sophistication . I have tried literally dozens of teas since being introduced to the Russian custom of preparing and drinking tea , and the Ahmad Imperial blend is probably my favorite of all of these due to the fact that it is equally delicious hot or iced . I buy the three-packs as needed from Amazon and go through them rapidly . My family loves it and my friends have it in their homes now too , try one box of it and you will love it too . This is an excellent tea . One of the best I have ever had . It is especially great when you prepare it with a samovar . Herbal additives in this blend destroy real tea taste . It is only for people who like herbal taste . I don\\'t . Makes a tasty , super easy meal , fast . BUT high in calories . < br / > < br / > The instructions say to saute the veggies first but I recommend cooking the chicken first . The chicken takes longer to cook and the raw chicken ontop of veggies just makes a slimy mess . I made it with snow peas and carrots only . I dont like the little corn . Added some red pepper flakes for heat and served ontop of rice . It came out wonderful ! Dinner on the table in less than 30mins . I think I have tried just about every Bloody Mary mixer on the market at one time or the other . Most have too much sugar or worst , corn syrup . This mixer is all natural ingredients and very tasty . It does have a little kick . Enjoy . Might be a little spicy for some , but this stuff rocks . I use 1/2 and 1/2 with V8 for a milder version , or the best is a Bloody Caesar ! < br / > Half mix , half clamato ! Took me one or two to get used to the pickle taste . But now aim hooked and have to keep a bottle on hand This candy is not as described . The middle is almost hard it is not a silky or smooth filling as described . < br / > Looks and tastes like it\\'s way past it\\'s expiration date . < br / > Would never reccommend this . Paid a good chunk of cash for nothing I started drinking the power slim tea when I was on the HCG diet to help curb cravings . Since I liked it so well , I tried some of the others and I am now hooked ! They are so satisfying that I drink them all the time . The Energy gives you that extra pick-me-up in the afternoons that helps keep me going all day , no matter how long . I\\'m trying several of the Wu Yi teas . I like this one particularly because of the subtle citrus taste . It also has a natural sweetness . < br / > < br / > The ingredients include Organic Wu-Li Cliff Oolong Tea ( 700 mg ) , Organic Black Tea ( 600 mg ) , Organic Green Tea Extract ( 100 mg ) , Proprietary blend ( 600 mg ) , plus some Ginseng ( panax ) , Orange Peel , Lemon Grass , and Guarana . Other Ingredients : Natual Orange and Citrus flavors . < br / > < br / > My goal is to drink more tea and less coffee . I am enjoying trying a different kind of tea every day . I\\'ll be coming back to this one . i cannot live without this citron falksalt , it is wonderful on watermelon , fish , almost any food requiring salt and in my world it all does . just try it on red juicy watermelon , wonderful experience . Terrible ! Artificial lemon taste , like Pledge Lemon Furniture Polish . Don\\'t do this to yourself . Just use plain flake salt and some fresh grated lemon zest . These things are huge ! I love the way the crystals crunch , and the flavor is not too overpowering or too subtle . This lemony flavor is my favorite--it\\'s good on almost everything . You\\'ll have plenty of flavored salt for a long time if you buy this . The taste of these white cheddar flat breads is like a regular cracker - which is not bad , except that I bought them because I wanted a cheese taste . < br / > < br / > What was a HUGE disappointment ? How misleading the packaging of the box is . The photo on the box ( I bought these in store ) makes it look like it is full of long flatbreads ( expanding the length and width of the box ) . Wrong ! The plastic tray that holds the crackers is about 2 \" smaller all around - leaving you with about 15 or so small flatbreads . < br / > < br / > What is also bad about this is that the company states they use biodegradable and eco-friendly packaging . FAIL ! They used a HUGE box for a ridiculously small amount of crackers . Not ecofriendly at all . < br / > < br / > Would I buy these again ? No - I feel ripped off . The other crackers ( like Sesame Tarragon ) give you a little < br / > more bang for your buck and have more flavor . This is the ultimate puppy food . The kibbles are great for small breeds . High in digestible nutrients as opposed to fillers some companies use . Less waste results from the high quality ingredients . I have been hunting , training , showing and handling various breeds of dogs for nearly 40 years , with multiple National Champions . I have been highly satisfied with Eukanuba\\'s quality and the results I have obtained feeding their foods . My recent purchases are with WAG , through AMAZON.com . Their prices are the best I have found and they are very good at shipping immediately on items in stock . The recommendation when we bought our puppies ( lhasa / bichon mix and lhasa / poodle mix ) was that we continue them on the food that they have had since being weaned . This is a somewhat expensive food so I can\\'t say that we were terribly pleased but we loaded up on the stuff and headed home . < br / > < br / > Let me just say this , I have had small dogs before . Never have I seen such gas issues . Both of them consistently had foul gas . Consistently . Usually when they\\'re sitting on our laps but , you know . They\\'re dogs . < br / > < br / > When we got through the first bag of this stuff , we purchased more on amazon . It was a great price for it since we got a 40 lb bag for the price of ( I think ) a 15 lb bag at Petco . But , they continued to have gas . I mean , they loved the food , don\\'t get me wrong and they loved it more when we\\'d mix in some water and it would be like soft food . Somehow that made their gas worse but I think I\\'ll have to give that responsible to the speed with which they chowed down - can\\'t blame the food itself for gluttony . < br / > < br / > Eventually , we switched their food . No more farting . I think it was due to the high fat content which undoubtedly is necessary for very small puppies . They just need that in their diet . I think that we were advised to keep them on it for much longer than was useful ( they said up until 1 year ) . Yeah right , you try dealing with gas for that long . Around 6 mos of age we switched to PuppyChow . Much better . Granted , they don\\'t like it as much , but we humans like it a whole lot better . A very delicate green tea with a smooth light taste and an subtle floral tones and no bitter aftertaste . < br / > < br / > In the 20 + years we have been drinking Ahmad teas not even once have we been disappointed . The superb quality of Ahmad teas has remained consistent throughout the years . < br / > < br / > I am so happy to find Ahmad teas available here ( thanks Amazon ! ) because only a few stores carry it in my area and they are quite a few miles away . The current deal for the pack of 6 is superb ( much cheaper than I can find locally ) . < br / > < br / > This is a great tasting tea , which I am happy to recommend . Fresh , a great way to get a little chocolate in my life without a million calories . They taste just like chocolate pudding . If you like the Ceylon tea variety , you will certainly enjoy and appreciate this tea . < br / > < br / > I am so happy to find Ahmad teas available here ( thanks Amazon ! ) and very surprised at the negative review from 2009 because in the 20 + years we have been drinking Ahmad teas not even once have we been disappointed . The superb quality of Ahmad teas has remained consistent throughout the years . < br / > < br / > The current deal for the pack of 4 is very good ( cheaper than I can find locally ) . < br / > < br / > Highly recommended . < br / > < br / > NOTE : This listing\\'s description is confusing . Each packet of tea weighs 500 grams , which equals 1.1 pounds or 17.6 ounces . I\\'ve been enjoying this tea for years . This tea is good mornings , afternoons or evenings . My local store went out of buisiness ... Thanks Amazon ! I use a bodum tea press to prepare a pot . Hi , I have to have black tea everyday . I have done it in the past 25 years and it\\'s a habit of mine . Ahmad tea is one of my favorite brands and I highly recommend it if you like black tea . I think this is going to remain my favorite for the next 100 years or so :) I have tried it out despite the other review and I found that this is exactly the same tea i buy in either Russian or Italian groceries . Ahmad Tea is an excellent looseleaf tea eith hot or for making iced tea . Great flavor with no lingering aftertaste . I\\'ve been drinking this tea for the past 8 or 10 years , usually buying a box or two when visiting large metropolitan areas , where many Middle-Eastern stores carry loose Ahmad teas , usually at $ 5-7 for a pound box . I\\'ve always considered it an unremarkable but robust tea , with enough aroma and taste , and beautiful reddish color , perhaps not good enough a tea to drink on its own , but a decent base for mixes . < br / > This tea , however , is nothing of the sort . Freshly opened package has almost no characteristic tea smell , and the brewed tea is weak , flat and tasteless . Somehow it just does not seem to be the same product anymore . So , you get a lot of tea for the money , but the quality is such that you might as well drink Lipton bags , they are not that much worse . I love love love this deal - it\\'s way fun to pick from so many ! Teas and chocolates and ciders as well as many coffees . The other outfits that assemble samplers are boring - they do the choosing , and from a much narrower range . The sellers here are very nice , also , and will answer questions via email about the slightly confusing ordering method ( it\\'s easy ) . If you want great packaging , forget it - they ship fast , and the kups are just tossed loose in a box . Who cares ? Once you\\'ve tried some random sampler packs ( and now are overloaded with decafs , extra bolds , or teas ) , this is a great way to get exactly the brands or style that you want . Received the order in a couple of days and was exactly what I ordered . This was my second order and I\\'ll be ordering this item again . good products and fast shipping equals a happy me . a little pricey but you can hand pick a few good flavors ... a few i cant find anywhere else so def worth the price If used on a daily basis you will keep your gums healty and between your teeth clean and free of plack . WOW ! This product is very impressive . I bought the 8oz blueberry and was pleased with packaging , price and shipping . The powder dissolves instantly . Even in water ! I\\'ve just been mixing a 1/4 tsp in a small glass of water for now and drinking it down and it tastes great ! , but will add it to my smoothies and juiced fruit juices next . This product is so economical compared to purchasing fresh blueberries , especially because there is no waste due to mold or overripe berries thrown away . I think you could add this to baked or unbaked foods as well . I\\'m excited to add more of the SuperFoods to my diet in this fast and easy way . I definitely will being trying the other flavors soon . The pork chops from Omaha Steaks were very tasty but at the same time exceptionally dry . Pork is usually dry meat but these were to the extreme . Possibly shipping them frozen and keeping them frozen was partly the problem . Five minutes in , one tentacle was bitten off , ball inside cracked in half . Not durable enough to be a dog toy . Disappointed :( . So is the dog :( . I am chemical sensitive as well as sugar-free . I have been using this product for over a year . I use it maybe once a week at the most . I drink 1/2 the bottle and then boost my energy after an hour or two depending on how I feel . IMO this doesn\\'t replace my a . m . coffee but is sweet in the early afternoon when I start to fade . Once in a while I drink a full bottle before a workout . I\\'ve been drinking Guayaki Yerba Mate teas for years . Compared to the many toxic energy boosters out there I highly recommend this . This product is clean and doesn\\'t leave nasty chems behind in the body . Try it before you judge from a review - everyone\\'s body reacts differently . I felt energized within five minutes , but it lasted for about 45 minutes . I paid $ 3.99 for this drink . I could have just drunk a cup of coffee and saved my money . Yes , it\\'s probably healthier than 5 - Hour Energy or Starbucks shots but if you\\'re looking to avoid a caffeine overload , this is still not for you . Most energy drinks cannot be made w / out a high dosage of caffeine . I believe the caffeine content of 1 Guayaki shot is 150 mL - probably lower than other un-healthy energy shot drinks but I believe most other people avoid the top brands b / c they contain too much caffeine and / or sugar . If you do not react well to caffeine , Guayaki is not a good buy either . I definitely feel an energy boost w / 1 full Guayaki shot but not w / out all the other caffeine side effects - irritability , nervousness , mood-swings . Caffeine overdose is why I stopped drinking coffee . But it looks even organic energy drinks are still not safe . < br / > < br / > Now you\\'re NOT sensitive to caffeine , then it\\'s a great buy . It\\'s not loaded w / sugar . The taste is easy and pleasant . It\\'s not loaded w / a bunch of chemicals like 5 - Hour shots or Starbucks drinks . And the energy boost lasts for about 4 to 5 hours . Takes about 5 to 7 minutes to kick in but all this probably depends on your body / weight . < br / > < br / > Side note - if you want to feel energized during the day , have a protein drink first thing in the morning and stay away for heavy , fattening foods during the day that will make you feel sluggish and sleepy ! These Nature Valley Nut Lovers Variety Pack was perfect . Although I wasn\\'t sure about the peanut butter bar , it was excellent . I loved the Roasted Almond , Roasted Pecan and the Peanut Butter . < br / > < br / > I will definately buy from this seller again . Quick shipping and very fresh . I so wish I would have read this review before purchasing TWO gallons of this oil for my health issues . It reeks like a chemical rubber smell . This smell is coming from the black rubber gasket in the lid . When I called to report the situation to the company , Sabrina told me I would have to pay to send them a sample to have tested by a lab . Unbelievable . Good customer service would indicate that they would pay for the product to be returned and give me a full refund , including shipping . The product is faulty . Period . I will never order anything from this company again and do not recommend it to anyone based on this horrible customer service and lack of responsibility and ownership . This product has a strong after-taste of Crayola crayons ! < br / > < br / > I am in the process of trying different brands of coconut oils for cooking purposes . Upon opening the plastic container , the aroma of crayons immediately fills the room , and this flavor permeates the food that is cooked in it . < br / > < br / > I suspect the source of the problem is the plastic used in the plastic container as I have not experienced this with any of the other brands purchased . < br / > < br / > To date , my favorite coconut oil is distributed by Barleans . The flavor is fantastic . However , they do not supply a gallon-sized tub , and Dr . Mercola has the best product in that size category . Had this shipped to my sister who follows a gluten-free eating plan and she reports that it is very versatile and easier than grinding almonds for a crispy crust on chicken and fish filets . Also uses it in place of bread crumbs in meatloaf and meatballs . Stays moist when added in place of wheat flour in baking , too . Good product , good value . These are healthy and my mixed Llasa , Tibetan Terrier adores them . And they are healthy and his breath doesn\\'t smell and his teeth are in good shape because of such products . A great healthy product . A great healthy chew for my 9 wk old beagle , Rio . He loves the taste and it sure beats my arm . I really enjoy this product . I had such a hard time finding it affordable in the store . Once I found it I look no further , it\\'s the only sugar I use . Thanks so much . I have used and liked Sugar in the Raw for many years , after being introduced to it in a Starbucks . My most recent purchase , however , was disappointing . The sugar was lighter in color and had a crystal size maybe 1/4 th of the regular size . Having large crystals was something I always really liked about Sugar in the Raw . It enhanced the quality of mixed drinks and of lattes . I called their hotline to complain and was told that they had had a problem with their recent sugar crop and that the result was less molasses in the sugar . They have had many complaints of a similar nature . This , they claimed , also reduced the crystal size . They said this problem should go away with their newer crop . The representative said that the new-crop sugar will have a 6-10 digit date code ( without ANY spaces ) that ends with a \" 1 \" and no letters . The trailing digits are a date code using the Julian calendar . ( My recent bad-purchase had a space after the initial sequence of numbers and then ended with a \" 51A \" ) . Bottom line : their current product is not much better than much cheaper products . When they get a better crop , I\\'ll go back to purchasing Sugar in the Raw . \" Sugar in the Raw \" ( tm ) Please Harvest Cane w / o Burning < br / > To be delivered to : HC & S < br / > Dear \" Sugar in the Raw \" folks , < br / > < br / > We who buy your product care about the environment . And we\\'d like to know that you care too . When you burn the cane fields on Maui , it adds to the CO2 and worsens climate change . And the smoke from your burning is damaging the lungs of your workers , your workers \\' children and the residents of Maui . < br / > < br / > We love your product and want you to change to no-burn harvesting so we can continue to buy it , knowing we aren\\'t contributing to Global Warming and lung disease . < br / > < br / > [ ... ] Love this sugar . I also get muscavado sugar and they are both great to use in place of regular white sugar . Recommend ! Product is exactly as advertised . What a savings ! At least half the retail price . Easy to store because of the individual packaging . I used to buy this sugar for years . I do not eat much sugar , but still . This sugar is called turbinado sugar , but is misleading . I picked this brand just because it says real turbinado sugar , and other brands ( in the local food store ) that their sugar is brown because it is colored with caramel or something . < br / > < br / > HOW did i find out ? I needed just a sweet water few days ago . I put this Sugar in The Raw in the glass . The water became brown and on the bottom of the glass i got just PURE WHITE SUGAR CRYSTALS ! ! ! What a shame on the producer ! U can try to put this sugar in your mouth and after few seconds you will spit out pure white crystals as well . < br / > < br / > I\\'m just wondering if the consumers can hold the company liable for such a practice . It\\'s just sugar in the raw , it\\'s flavor profile is much better then white sugar and it\\'s suppose to be better for you or something . I just wish the bags were resealable . This is a delicious sugar . It has a pretty light brown color and delicious aroma . But the granules are quite big , however - - bigger than plain refined sugar . This makes is difficult to cream butter and sugar together . But if you use it in a recipe where you will melt the sugar first before baking it , or if you use it to brew beer and plan to boil it to melt it , it is a great product . It would be the perfect sugar if only the granules were a bit finer . I only use raw sugar , it did seem a little smaller than the normal crystals but it is still good . Will buy again . This sugar is very good . Use this in your coffee , cereal , etc for a week and you\\'ll never go back to white sugar , white sugar will taste terrible . Plus from what I\\'ve read , this Raw sugar contains a lot of minerals that are missing in our diets . < br / > < br / > The product was delivered fast and well-packaged . My only complaint is the price . I wish I could find Raw sugar cheaper . I would be happy to buy in bulk , but this is the cheapest I have found . I thought this was a great buy , but as noted by Scott D . , the molasses content was not up to par . I loved the higher molasses content \" Sugar in the Raw \" . Unfortunately what I purchased recently does not have the higher molasses content and I have twelve 24 ounce bags . I guess I\\'ll watch for the next crop . I really love this sugar and price-wise it\\'s much cheaper to buy it here on amazon compared to anywhere else . Love this sugar . It tastes so much better and isn\\'t as overly sweet tasting as \" regular \" sugar . We\\'ve used it in quite a few baking items and they always turn out very good . The price that Amazon has this set at is very good to and makes it easy to use this for everyday stuff . Can\\'t say anything bad about Sugar in the Raw . I like it better than the other \" natural \" sugars . Better consistency and - I know it doesn\\'t matter - but better color . Unfortunately , one of the \" natural \" paper bags got torn a bit in the box . It didn\\'t look like the box was damaged so I can\\'t tell how it happened , but it was sort of pain to clean up half a bag that spilled all over the inside of the box and our kitchen when I opened it . Not sure what the solution is and I\\'d order it again , but if it happens again , I\\'d switch to one of the brands that ship in an unnatural plastic bag . Great service ! Items arrived faster than expected . Very efficient ! Will use this seller again . I highly recommend this seller ! Thank you for the excellent service ! Please ignore the one-star comments , if you check the bag the main ingredient IS in fact whole grain brown rice and the second is rice flower . With anything that is gluten free you have to add another \" binder \" which is where the corn flour comes in . For someone who has celiac disease and cannot have Sunchips , because they contain wheat ( a key binder to any chip , cookie or cereal ) this is an excellent product . My spouse and I buy these a lot because they are gluten free and absolutely delicious ! Best flavor ever ! I\\'m addicted ! They are all good but these are by far the best . I could live on these ! And there is no need for anymore to say ... So many \" healthy \" products don\\'t taste very good . Or taste good when you first try them and then go downhill . I\\'ve had these chips on more than one occasion and they are very tasty . I\\'ve served them to guests twice and both times they wanted to know what they were and where to get them . It\\'s also nice to have something gluten-free for friends who are borderline diabetic ... but I would eat them anyway . I found these crisps at our local WalMart & figured I would give them a try . They were so yummy I may never go back to regular chips , not that I was a big chip fan anyway . The only problem is I can eat the entire bag in one sitting . I give these crisps a big thumbs up ! This is one of the best tasting crisps I have ever eaten ! I only buy it on special occassions because I know I\\'ll eat the whole bag . I paid $ 1.79 for a 2 ounce pkg of these at lunch today . I bought them because brown rice is a \" good \" carb . As soon as I tasted one and it tasted like a corn chip I checked the ingredients . The name is deceptive - these have \" Masa corn flour \" listed in the ingredients and it overwhelms the taste . I won\\'t buy these again - I can get Sunchips for less money and similar taste . I use the Rotel Mild and I LOVE this product so much--it saves me on a daily basis . If you\\'re trying to cook lower fat , healthier foods and in a HURRY , this stuff makes it so much easier . Ever notice that some canned tomatos have a weird \" tin can \" taste when you make spagehetti sauce or whatever ? For some reason this product doesn\\'t have that . It tastes so good you can just dump it in with a can of beans , heat and eat . < br / > < br / > or add some chili powder and now you have chili soup . I also make indian dishes with this , and spicey spaghetti sauce . I also prefer this to most canned salsas , so it works for things like quesadillas if you drain the liquid off . < br / > < br / > None of my local grocery stores carry it at all , nor do they carry anything like it . So I have to pay Amazon\\'s inflated price to order this by the case . I don\\'t like that I\\'m paying a higher price , but I LOVE LOVE LOVE the product . the price on this product certainly raises my attention on compairing amazon price with the local stores . i can get a can of this rotel at my local kroger for $ 1 . dissapointing ! howdy y\\'all , < br / > < br / > the actual product is VERY good - i\\'d rate the item a 4 on it\\'s own . however , it\\'s only ONE dollar at the local grocery and - @ twenty eight + dollars per twelve pack - these are running almost two and a half dollars each . < br / > < br / > as i said , TOO EXPENSIVE . [ * sigh ... * ] i was really hoping to get them at something approaching the local cost . < br / > < br / > take care , < br / > lee Nothing wrong with the product , but I sure had to mix it with * lots * of other ingredients to make it edible to me . ( In Texas I was called a \" baby-mouth \" - not into very spicy-hot foods . ) < br / > < br / > For comparison , I\\'m comfortable with Tostitos medium chunky salsa . 1 can of this milder Rotel , mixed with 2 slightly larger cans of diced tomatoes , was still way too hot for me to use as salsa for chips . I used some of this to make a sort of southwestern cornbread that was good though . This is a fantastic product , and I wish it was readily available in most stores . It\\'s taste is not the greatest , but it\\'s a 2.5 oz . shot , and it\\'s gone in a second . It tastes , more or less , like a concentrated sweet tea . For the record , I\\'ve had 5 hour energy , and that tastes FAR worse . I will put up the taste for the results . It\\'s got 150mg of caffeine , which is the equivalent of the big red bulls and monsters . I can\\'t stand sucralose and sugar substitutes , and this is one of the only shot sized energy drinks that has only sugar in it . The sugar is at 9g , which isn\\'t horrible . I used to drink 4 16oz . Red Bulls a day for the caffeine , and this gives me far better energy , and is much more subtle . My preference is black coffee , but I can\\'t drink 8-12 cups a day anymore . Overall , Steaz does it right ; real organic ingredients in moderate amounts , and they create big results . I have to get up really early to work out before work and I get super tired by the middle of the afternoon . I was drinking one 5 hour energy , usually extra strength , each day . It worked well , but gave me a jittery feeling , almost headachy but not quite . My husband got me to try this and I was skeptical , but for me it works as well if not better than the 5 hour energy and doesn\\'t give me that jittery almost-headache feeling . < br / > < br / > I don\\'t mind the taste--it reminds me of the inside of a fig newton ( mmm ) . And the price is ok , on Amazon anyway . At my grocery store they were almost $ 3 each , yike ! < br / > < br / > And it\\'s organic--so I can feel good about it , right ? It\\'s all about me feeling good ! I bought these for my husband and he said they are the best energy shots out there . He takes one in the mornings and works hard all day . Good stuff ! I am a energy junkie and I\\'m not sure if this works or not , but what I do know is that the taste is not the greatest . I do drink the steaz energy drink and I think I get the same results . I like this products because it is more natural then the others . If you want an organic energy shot , your choices are this one from Steaz and the assorted flavors from Guayaki . Guayaki Yerba Mate is actually in the Steaz energy shot and energy drinks , and they both use Sambazon Acai , so there are some similarities in ingredients . < br / > < br / > Great energy burst for 4 + hours on a Steaz Energy Shot , and no withdrawals or headaches afterwards . Plan on drinking one every day at lunch at work . This will help me cut down on my iced coffees , which are not helping my calorie intake . < br / > < br / > Already ordering 12 - packs on subscribe and save , 2 per month . Great value . I was looking for a natural energy shot that works , and I found it . Steaz energy shot is my favorite ! < br / > < br / > I recently had gastric bypass surgery , so tons of sugar is a no-no . And I\\'m also allergic to Sucralose ( Splenda ) so most other energy drinks are out . < br / > < br / > I tried Bazi energy shots and they didn\\'t work as well as Steaz , and definitely didn\\'t taste as well . These have a taste that\\'s almost like Coca-Cola--not bad at all . < br / > < br / > If you\\'re looking for natural energy , give these a try . I had tried both of the Guayaki energy shots and I don\\'t like the taste of either of them ! This one has more natural caffeine and tastes much better . I like them cold for sure . My husband and I take these on road trips in a little cooler with ice and waters and we don\\'t have to make stops for coffee ! Especially on the turnpikes where it\\'s just way too expensive . It\\'s worth the $ [ ... ] per shot . We normally split them . I\\'m really sensitive to caffeine , even the natural kind so I get a little weird if I drink the whole thing but that\\'s the same for coffee too for me . My husband drinks the whole shot and gets a nice wake up boost . I would recommend these over any of the sinthetic shots out there . You can feel good about putting this in your body ! I\\'ll be ordering again soon for sure =) I purchased it because it was on sale . In terms of the energy it provides , it works , but the taste leaves something to be desired . I tried mixing it with some water to make it more drinkable . I\\'ve been feeling extremely tired around the late afternoon . As a software engineer , this is entirely unacceptable ! So , I asked the nice lady at the counter of my local Whole Foods Market , for something that will give me that extra energy I need to get through the day . < br / > < br / > She excitedly returned with a suspicious little green bottle . Over three hours after drinking whatever that was , my brain is still working at unnatural speeds . To summarize my experiences : I believe this works . < br / > < br / > She did explain that I needed to drink plenty of water with it , which I personally feel helped the energy level . So if you\\'re feeling tired during the day and hate coffee , give this a shot - preferably before you eat anything . < br / > < br / > Woot ! The energy shot truly does work ! It had a terrible after-taste at first , but now that I know what to expect , I am getting used to it . I always have some water handy as a chaser ... which helps ! I am so glad to have found something that gives me the energy I need without all the chemicals found in other beverages . It\\'s helped me kick my addiction to Diet Coke and other aspartame-laced caffeinated beverages . Yay ! ! ! I\\'ve tried 5 - hour energy , red rain , NOS , and other energy shots . This is my favorite in terms of taste and effect . Plus , it\\'s somewhat reassuring to know that natural ingredients are used . Sometimes I wonder what I\\'m really putting into my body with some of the other brands . I purchase a box about once every 2 months for the past 2 years . If you\\'re looking for an energy boost without artificial sweeteners and other chemicals , this is a great option . The taste is decent and it is a nice smooth uplift without jitters . I first found Steaz Berry Energy Shots at a local organic market . I bought two bottles , which cost just under three dollars each . I fell in love instantly . The drink is delicious - - I can taste the yerba mate and the acai juice , like a slightly bitter fruity chocolate honey tea . I am very sensitive to sucralose ( Splenda ) which is in so many energy drinks these days ; I also hate the taste . I love that Steaz has actual sugar and no artificial sweeteners . The rush it gives me is slow and even . I have several medical conditions , including fibromyalgia , which saps me of energy and causes intense pain . I like how Steaz helps clear away the fatigue and fog so I can get things done . No caffeine jitters , even though there are 150 mg of caffeine in each bottle . < br / > It was becoming expensive for me to buy the bottles separately at stores , so I started looking online for a bulk price . I am so thrilled to have found the Pack Of 12 on Amazon . I signed up for Amazon Prime specifically for this product , hah ! I have tried other energy shots and this one is the only one that really makes me feel good and energized without any other sides effects at all , its also the best taste , others taste like medicine , this one has a tea fresh taste . I love it . I drive OTR ... Over the Road truck and this helps to keep me alert . It has no sugar high & no crash . I\\'m on a autoship which i like . The price is very good . I\\'ve seen it over 2 bucks in the store . Products takes pretty good , and it doesn\\'t leave you gittery . With subscibe and save as well as Prime membership I pay below $ 2 a shot . My wife tried them and now she drinks them like they are going out of style . I moderate mine and they make for more effective use before weight training . I recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a healthier alternative to high sugar and unnatural products that are everywhere that still gives you the results of an AWESOME Energy Drink . I use this product daily , and it provides a steady stream of energy . I do not get jittery or crash . It also helps me practice portion control because it acts as a slight appetite suppressant . I\\'ve been buying and drinking this for over a year now , and the energy boost is excellent , with a continuous , ~ 6 - hour effect . The most recent shipments seem to have improved the flavor slightly as well , or perhaps I\\'m getting more used to it . I don\\'t drink it for the flavor , but it\\'s not as heinous as the fake flavors found in the other , non-organic energy shots . This is the first time I\\'ve really been misled by other reviews on amazon . I like 5 - hr Energy , I find Rain ok and so I thought I\\'d try this product based on the reviews . Boy am I sorry ! I gagged getting one bottle down even with my nose pinched ( really ) . And it leaves the worst medicinal taste in your mouth afterwards . 8 tic tacs at once did not get rid of it ! But worst of all , within an hour I was yawning and drowsy . Unless you really like things that taste of a weird tea-flavored cough syrup and don\\'t work , don\\'t buy this ! I don\\'t know what to do with the other 11 bottles . big fail I loved this mold ! I wished I could have used it for more than one occasion , but it didn\\'t last . I did use it to make 30 + suckers for my daughter\\'s first birthday . But there was going to be no way that the mold could be salvaged after that . I would have liked to have kept to use on other occasions , but for the price it didn\\'t matter to me that much . It served it\\'s main purpose :) You HAVE to try the VANILLA Tootsie Rolls ! The regular chocolate ones are good , but THESE are the BEST EVER ! ! Try this you might like it . I did and I am quite addicted , it is too easy to prepare , it tastes great and it absorbs the flavors you cook it with . The price is really good and well worth the purchase . If you like this type of Couscous like I do , then give this one a try.It can be eaten hot , room temp or in a cold salad with a variety of greens and other flavors , it takes on the other flavors very well when mixed . I cooked the Couscous with a broth and oilive oil for added flavor and it rocked my taste buds big time . I will be back for more . This tri-color couscous is really good ... full of flavor and fun to eat . I love the texture . I cook in chicken broth and add some minced garlic and chopped herbs ( parsley , cilantro , ) along with some red pepper flakes . At the end of cooking , I add some olive oil and this makes a wonderful side dish ... Highly recommend I tried to find israeli couscous in a number of upsacale grocery stores and no luck . So I decided to try good ole Amazon.com and selected this product . It is so good .. add a few herbs and it\\'s a great side dish , or add more and make a \" pasta type \" salad.so very good . I am hooked . Great flavor and so easy to prepare ! The package came with the label torn off and no cooking instructions . I know how I normally cook Couscous so tried 3/4 cup water to 1 cup couscous-brought to a boil and let sit , covered for 5min . It was mushy and tasteless.We have thrown out the rest of the container . I wouldn\\'t even think of buying this product unless I know the price per unit . How can I compare other items online or in a store ? I love ordering whole bean coffee on Amazon . I like this so much that this my first product review . I have to say that I\\'m usually not a big fan of flavored coffee , but I thought I would give it a try . When my husband started grinding it up , I could smell it throughout the house . Sometimes with flavored coffees , the smell is there but the taste isn\\'t . However , not with this one . I\\'m now going to order another flavor from this company and will give it a try . I love this coffee . I do wish it came already ground as I don\\'t have a grinder and use a blender instead . But it\\'s worth it . Many flavored coffees I\\'ve tried only seem to have a flavored odor that doesn\\'t reach the coffee , but this one manages both . This brand of coffee has been available in my local stores for some time - - I\\'ve believe the company is local . I\\'ve been drinking it for quite some time and have not tired of it . I\\'m particularly fond of the Turtle Sundae but all the flavors are good . I can\\'t say that I\\'ve had a bad one . < br / > < br / > As it turns out , it\\'s less expensive to order it from Amazon and have it show up at my front door than it is for me to run out to the local Walmart to get it . It\\'s a no brainer . Try it , if you like rich , flavored coffee , you\\'ll like it . It is hot ! I love it , tasty and a little sweet . I usually scoff at salsas labeled as hot , but this one lives up to its billing . I consume about a jar every two weeks of this , either adding it to fajitas or using it as a corn chip dip . It is hot , but after awhile the medium Salsa Suprema was too mild for me ; I thought maybe I\\'d cut down how much I ate by going to the hot Salsa Ranchera . It\\'s hot enough that people who aren\\'t used to it will say \" That\\'s hot ! \" . < br / > < br / > Flavor : bright and forward . The similarly hot Salsa Victoria is a duller taste to me , I guess earthy . This salsa is much brighter in the mouth . I don\\'t like to go hotter than this because the sauces I\\'ve tried lose any resemblance to yummy salsa and just taste hot ( this happens to me with Tabasco sauce , for example ) . < br / > < br / > A drawback is La Victoria doesn\\'t make a larger bottle of Salsa Ranchera nor Salsa Victoria , nor do they sell them in [ ... ] or Sam\\'s Club . To get a good deal you have to watch for sales . service was great , but I meant to buy Swiss Chalet chicken SAUCE not the Marinade :) < br / > < br / > Love the sauce - have yet to try the marinade Use frequently as we like to do Asian dishes at least once a week . Love this product . Fast shipping , as usual . Would buy again . These individually wrapped pieces are delicious ( although I wish there were a few more ) . Mildly sweet with no sugar-free aftertaste , even a traditional \" marzipan-aholic \" should enjoy these . Put this in my husbands stocking for Christmas and it was a hit . I was amazed at how quickly it arrived ! It is a cute stocking stuffer , but only OK as far as user appeal . You get what you pay for . Toy was typical quality I expected . I got taken for a major ride on the shipping ! So we cancelled the order . It was cancelled without any problem . That is a positive note ... i love the convenience of the singles . The best creamer around.Taste is just like the big bottle . I can stick them in my purse and take them to work . These creamers come in 4 packs of 25 . I have taken one to work and opened one for home so far , and haven\\'t found a single broken or leaking creamer yet . I usually have way too much cream and sugar in my coffee , but with these it is easy for me to cut down on the sweetness because I won\\'t allow myself more than 2 creamers per cup . I think this is definitely the best option for buying creamers from Amazon since all the other listings have a lot of complaints about creamers breaking in shipping ! Even though we are International Delight fans we were not completely dissapointed by this product . We had no problem with the shipment , but the creamer itself is thinner than International Delight . Other than that we are happy :D Besides the obvious convenience and portability of the individual creamers , I liked this item specifically because of packaging . I couldn\\'t believe how many reviews I read about coffee creamer cups ; but many of the Amazon creamer options ( both Coffeemate and International Delight ) had multiple negative reviews due to the shipment arriving with broken cups thanks to sloppy packaging . < br / > < br / > That was not an issue here . The shipment arrived in four dispensing boxes of 50 each ( as shown in the photo ); those boxes were tightly packed in a thick cardboard box which could take a good beating before damaging the inner boxes . Thus , none of my cups were broken , no waste and no sloppy drippy mess . Plus the four boxes means I could put one in the kitchen , one in the bathroom ( we moved our mini Keurig there when we upgraded the kitchen Keurig - best idea my husband ever had ) , and one at work , with a reserve for whichever runs out first . < br / > < br / > If you are looking for these mini creamers but deterred like I was by the negative packaging reviews on other options , this is your best bet . As a bonus , the auto delivery price is very reasonable . This seller is very nice . And the price is very good . The only reason I stop ording is bacause I went to sugar free , and at that time he did not have it . But for those of you that don\\'t have to watch there fat in take , I would get this product from them . I purchased these coffee mate singles to use at work along with the coffee \" tea \" bags . They\\'re great because they don\\'t require refrigeration . I received the items in a timely manner . Upon receipt , I removed a pack to consume . The pop-tart was STALE and left an awful taste in my mouth . I found these new spring Pop-Tarts and bought them on a whim . My kids and I were amazed and delighted at the fun , colorful , amazingly detailed artwork on these Pop-Tarts . Fantastic for after school snacks , lunch boxes , and school treats . Tie with a ribbon for a bright \" thinking of you this spring \" gift . The only challenge is finding more in stores . Way to go Kellogg\\'s - fantastic product ! Yes , I am having a cup right now . I went all over town looking for this coffee after been invited to a non profit organization to a banquet and besides the delicious food they top it off with this amazing delicious coffee . I paid and extra 20 bucks to get it right way and it is worth the money . Highly recommend . Taste like it is stale . Will not order this again . I had this coffee at a 50th year annerversery at a reception hall and had to have it . This stuff tasted NOTHING , like the Douwe Egberts at the hall . This is possibly stale coffee . Serveice delivery with the seller was excellent . The product was not . Will not order again . Bad taste . Iam not sure if it was old or that how it tastes . I throw it right away , i coudl not drink it . This is honestly THE BEST seasoning salt in all the land . It tightens up any dish ; not spicy , just perfectly seasoned . It\\'s perfect , hence , my purchase of this 35 oz . mamma jamma . The order arrived as advertised . I have had only a few chances to use it , but it is awesome . The flavor is exactly what I hoped for ! It may take me a while to finish the entire gallon , but I will definnantly order again ! I like a lot of sesame oil and use it in salads regularly . Great quality , flavor and aroma . Can\\'t beat that its organic ! Bought a set of two when my son was about 6 months , and we started taking them with us whenever we went out to eat . I cut up cantaloupe , apple , banana ( even used sweet potatoes a few times ) - - just whatever I could get at the restaurant - - and it would keep my son busy long enough that I could actually eat ! It\\'s great because I didn\\'t have to be overly worried about him choking on big chunks , and he got to try out new foods . I wouldn\\'t hesitate to buy this again . I have a slightly different version of this - different brand . My son started using it around six months , and he really enjoys it . He DOES get messy if he eats something sticky or juicy like banana or watermelon , but whatever ... Anyway , I also had trouble cleaning it , until I tried scrubbing it with a nail or vegetable brush . That works pretty well . It takes some time , but not as much as it would take to run food through a food mill or blender , or cut it up , then clean it up off him , the chair , the floor , the dog , me , well you get the picture . What a GREAT idea ! ! ! My daughter love it . < br / > I don\\'t think is difficult to wash , I mean , is not like just toss water and that\\'s it ... but , come on ! ! ! < br / > Absolutely recommend it ! This product is impossible to wash and actually get cleaned . I couldn\\'t get the food pieces out to save my life . I tried scrubbing them out and even washed it in the dishwasher as it suggests . I loved this product for fruits and other food that I didn\\'t want my new baby to choke on . I also used it to put ice in when my baby was teething . It worked great for this , as well as for the food . I didn\\'t like bananas in it though-impossible to get clean ! I love , love , love the idea of this product and my little one loves , loves , loves to use it . She gets fresh fruit and other tasty things and I don\\'t have to worry about her choking . The only drawback is that bits of food get stuck in the mesh and the seams and are impossible to get out . Granted , some foods are more difficult than others and some don\\'t cause that much of a problem . Bananas however , have pretty much destroyed a couple of them . While I love this product , I think that next time I will get the one that has the removable and replaceable mesh bags . The Munchkin fresh food feeder is an okay product , it\\'s kind of like sucking on food through a cloth . While my daughter was interested in it for a little while , she eventually lost interest . I may introduce it back to her again and see how she reacts . This product is amazing . I know a few people with little ones that use these and they LOVE them ! ! Super easy to clean and use . When ordering these , I was under the impression that there were 2 per package ... FYI-they\\'re not ! ! Only one per ... I ordered these for my coffee themed wedding . When they arrived I had to fight off friends because they smelled and tasted so good . I literally had to hide the box to the wedding ! They were a big hit on my wedding day and there were none left over that we put on the tables . It was a great tasting product for the lowest price I\\'ve seen ! \" These are delicious ! The chocolate is excellent and the espresso bean was the perfect roast for this purpose . Crunchy and not bitter . \" < a href = \" http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00067AD4U \" > Chocolate Covered Espresso Beans 5 Pounds </a> The product was exactly as advertised and fresh . Unfortunately , I keep them in a candy dish in the office and they are going fast . We need to reorder to keep up with \" demand \" These chocolate covered espresso beans are wonderful ! The chocolate is very dark and rich and the \" bean \" inside is a very delightful blend of flavors with just enough caffine to really give it a zing . Popchips are so good . I have been following Weight Watchers and lost 50 pounds and am at my goal . These Popchips are my salty crunchy indulgence . They taste so good , I\\'ve purchased dozens of bags of this pancake mix ( which is a great product , by the way ) . This is the highest price I\\'ve seen . Whole Foods carries this item and it\\'s been on sale there for $ 9.99 ( that\\'s Canadian dollars , too , as I\\'m in Canada ) . It\\'s even cheaper on Baker\\'s Box\\'s own website , and they\\'re the company selling this product through Amazon . For a two-pack they should be charging $ 20 or less . What gives ? I thought Amazon was where you could find competitive prices . The Sugar was sweet , that can not be denied . As advertised , It didn\\'t melt when baked either . However , it will not do for your Liege Waffles / Gaufres what the larger pebbles of Belgian pearl will do . These grains are smaller , think pretzel salt , or seed pearls . That\\'s exactly what I was looking for to bake some chouquettes ( puffs with small sugar pearls on top ) . Works great , yum ! ! This is what I was looking for and was missing it . The taste is exactly the taste as the one made in India so just loved it and remember my days back in India . Definitely recommend it . I bought this strawberry extract hoping to spruce up a strawberry wine that ended up with less flavor than I\\'d original expected . ( A common problem in some fruit wines . ) < br / > < br / > This is , indeed , good strawberry flavor ! Just add to your sugary concoction ( be it a baking good , a dessert or a drink ) to either give strawberry flavor ( or add to existing flavor ) , and presto , just about everyone will be licking their lips ( and maybe fingers ) . < br / > < br / > For those interested , I found the right addition to a liquid volume to be 4 oz of extract per 1 gallon of liquid . Great stuff and dependable , especially when there are a million brands \" out there \" to choose from . I love the stuff . For really high end desires , I go with the Apollo Olive Oils from California . But I buy a whole lot more of this stuff and will buy it again and again . I hadn\\'t tried ( or heard of ) till recently Weavers not it\\'s my favorite . I am running through the list of types they have looking for a favorite and haven\\'t found one yet , they\\'re all so darned smooth . No bite , no after taste , a little pricy but still worth it . No worse price wise than starbucks or peets . Will keep running through the list here and see what happens . Love them all so far . Having always been a strict Peet\\'s Coffee lover , I was reticent to switch brands but Weaver\\'s won my heart ! ! The taste is clean and strong , the ethos is correct ( organic , baby ) and even the packaging is very zen and appropriate . Be still my caffeinated heart ! Go ahead and drink the other brands served at your neighborhood cafe if you must but make sure you have a stash of Weaver\\'s Peru Organic Whole Bean at home to serve up to your friends and family who deserve the best coffee . And when you go back to that corner cafe where people drink average coffee because they don\\'t know better , take along a travel mug filled with Weaver\\'s coffee from home and enjoy a real Cup of Joe . Er , Weaver\\'s . A very bitter tasting coffee even when enhanced with cream and / or honey . Definately not my cup of coffee . Oh , did i say it was bitter ? Im learning that Latin American and South American coffees have this distinct \" coffee \" caramelish finish . As a Peets Coffee fanatics we learned that Weavers roaster was the roaster for Peet\\'s and we are hooked ! I already reviewd the French and Organic blend , but I must say this coffee here is a perfect afternoon drink . < br / > Met the weavers team at the Warner Brothers party and they gave me a half a pound of french roast . Since them we are fans . < br / > You wont be dissapointed ! I like eating these whenever I need an energy boost . < br / > It has everything that I am searching for in a , \" To Go Snack \" . < br / > Fiber plus Chocolate is never a bad thing ! ! ! These are my favorite bars ever . The combo of raisons and dark choc is wonderful ! Very filling ! These are hard to find in the stores . I\\'m thankful for subsrcibe and save ! My fiance loves these dark chocolate and nut granola bars and all the grocery stores around us don\\'t carry them anymore ! Once again , Amazon came through and he couldn\\'t be happier . I was buying Quaker Oats granola bars but these Nature Valley chewy bars are better tasting , they make a great snack when I\\'m on the go . Chocolate , peanuts and raisins ... it doesn\\'t get any better . Hard to get husband to eat breakfast before school . He takes two bars now and is very happy to do so . It is often hard to find flavor in local grocery stores . So again , Amazon.com came through with a reasonable price . Now , I came keep the husband\\'s breakfast ready as he runs out the door in the mornings . I often like to have a bar in the evening as a night snack . \" Nantucket Blend coffee is one of my favorites . I was suprised that it was a single box . every time I ordered before it was a 2 pack . My fault for not reading closer . I will not order any more at this price for 1 ( 24 count ) Green Mountain \" Nantucket Blend \" K-Cups make a very good cup of coffee in my < a href = \" http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AQPMHA \" > Keurig B - 40 B40 Elite Gourmet Single-Cup Home-Brewing System </a> . This is a very smooth tasting brew that my wife prefers over the < a href = \" http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XDZIK \" > Coffee People , Donut Shop K-Cups for Keurig Brewers ( Pack of 50 ) [ Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging </a> ] I generally drink in the morning . < br / > < br / > These are good on both \" Small \" and \" Large \" cup settings as well . < br / > < br / > Highly Recommended ! < br / > < br / > CFH When we received our Keurig Elite for Christmas , we were so excited to break open the sample pack of pods to try out different blends and flavors . Of the 12 pods we had in the box , four were Green Mountain Coffee brand . I\\'d never tried anything from this company before , but from what I had researched online , they have the largest range of Keurig pods and have even bought out competitors to produce coffee under their brand names as well . < br / > < br / > Unfortunately , I was immediately disappointed by the quality of the coffee . We tried their Dark Magic , Decaf and Breakfast Blend and all were underwhelming , to say the least . I was almost completely set on writing off Green Mountain altogther . < br / > < br / > We had one GM pod left and being of the mindset of waste-not-want-not , I figured I\\'d give it one last go around before forgetting about them completely . And I\\'m glad I did . < br / > < br / > The Nantucket Blend is a perfectly pleasing cup of coffee . It is nice and flavorful without being thick and pungent ( unlike some of the other GM blends we tried ) . I added some flavored creamer to it and it almost measures up to our go-to Caribou Blend pods . Almost . All in all , this is a very standard cup of coffee which , while it isn\\'t anything new or exciting , is very pleasing and definitely one of the better Keurig options we\\'ve been able to test out . When we run out of all the pods we\\'ve accumulated , I\\'ll probably pick up a box of these as well . < br / > < br / > Now that I know Green Mountain isn\\'t completely disappointing I\\'ll definitely be open to trying a few more of their coffees ( with our promotion for getting the bewer we ordered < a href = \" http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004I3Y4IE \" > Green Mountain Coffee Golden French Toast , K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers , 24 - Count </a> to try as well ) and see how it goes from there . < br / > < br / > If you\\'re looking for a go-to choice , this is your cup ! Green Mountain is my favorite brand . Nantucket is my favorite coffee from Green Mountain . Very smooth flavor . Not too strong and not too weak . I was looking for a replacement for Timothy\\'s Kona Blend which is no longer carried on Amazon . This coffee from Green Mountain is very nice , but not strong enough for me . If you like milder coffees , then this one is for you . One of Green Mountains best blends of coffee in my opinion , love it for your everyday blend , perfect stregnth , excellent blend ! This is just Fantastic Chicken Noodle soup , the best I have ever eaten , with large hearty chunks of chicken , and vegetables and nice large noodles . This soup is just so full bodied , and is seasoned just right . I am so glad Amazon carries this product . I just can\\'t find it here in Vermont . I have used this oil for several years and it is the best for eating with bread or cooking , I love the regular , I use it on everything . You won\\'t be sorry you tired it , great for dipping bread and cooking omelet , and green beans . Oh my gosh , is this good ! Like most people , I\\'ve been eating ketchup my whole life and never really thought anything about it . Then Hubby brought a jar of this home . The tomato flavor is amazing . I will never buy store ketchup every again . Sir Kensington\\'s did a great job of updating the classic ketchup with this wonderful product . The refreshed taste of this Ketchup is a great update , and now leaves me disappointed when I\\'m given Heinz while out at a restaurant . < br / > < br / > For you Heinz die hard fans out there , this is not the ketchup for you . But for those of you who wish you always knew what ketchup could be without the chemical aftertaste found in Heinz , be sure to give this Ketchup a try . < br / > < br / > Don\\'t forget the spiced variety . Purchasing the pack with both the classic and spiced variety for your first Sir Kensington experience is definitely the way to go . This is ridiculous . The best gourmet ketchup I have ever tasted . It is pricey , but wow .. love this stuff . It would make a great gift for someone who is hard to buy for but loves their ketchup . Yummy ! The tomatoes are the star of the classic flavor . It is clean and really fresh ! Perfect on an avocado chicken sandwich . < br / > < br / > The spicy flavor is more complex and is the best ketchup I have ever tried . It is so good I have now used it on foods that would make me seem crazy ! The spicy version of this ketchup isn\\'t bad , but it is too expensive . The regular version is sweet as dessert . Horrible . Annie\\'s Organic has a much better flavor and costs a lot less . Even Heinz organic is a better deal . I gave it three stars instead of two because it is in glass , not plastic . These condiments are overpriced and terrible . The classic is disgustingly sweet . The spiced tastes like a bad spicy marinara sauce from a chain restaurant . I have been using porcini mushrooms in my cooking for twenty plus years . The Roland extra fancy porcinis that I purchased from you are the best that I have ever used , including the mushrooms that I bought in Italy and transported back to the USA . I was pretty pleased with these mushrooms . They were mostly large pieces , re-hydrated well and had good flavor . I\\'d estimate about 25 % of the contents were broken into medium to small pieces , most likely due to the shaking about in transit . Not a problem since I sometimes break the large pieces into smaller ones for some recipes . There was a small amount ( perhaps an ounce or so ) of very small / minced-size / dust-like pieces . Still useful to add into gravies and the like . Nothing gets wasted ! < br / > < br / > The label says it is a product of China and Italy . Nothing was specified as to the proportion from each country . < br / > < br / > I\\'m quite fond of dried mushrooms . While they may lack the texture you can get only when using fresh ones , the convenience of always having them on hand is a big plus . Additionally , I find the broth used to re-hydrate them adds a wonderful flavor to soups and stews . To save time and add flavor , I sometimes add the dried mushrooms directly into the soup or stew without re-hydrating them . Really helps meld all the flavors together . I also am fond of adding some to the cooking water when boiling pasta . The pasta picks up a wonderful earthy flavor when it cooks in the mushroom-infused water . < br / > < br / > This was the first time I used the Roland brand ( got it on a price dip from the Amazon Warehouse ) , and would certainly buy them again . Highly recommend . If you are a peanut lover , these are for you . Much larger than cocktail peanuts . Six people on my Christmas gift list ask for these every year ! ! The cashews were nice and big , with the vast majority being whole . There were a number of small pieces at the bottom of the bag , but that\\'s pretty expected with so many cashews . They made an absolutely excellent cashew brittle . < br / > < br / > My order took just over a week to arrive , which was pretty decent considering it was shipped across the country . They came double bagged in clear plastic bags , and in two 5 lb portions . This was highly convenient since I could just throw one of the bags into the freezer until I was ready to work with it . < br / > < br / > Great value for the price . Although there were several \" shriveled \" ones , they taste just fine . I mostly use them to make vegan sauces and other recipes that call for running them through a food processor so they don\\'t have to look perfect anyways . For the price , they are a great deal ( about half of what I find them for in the store ) I ordered these after a fair bit of searching online - even ordering the smaller 1-3 oz bags . I will admit , I was a bit sceptical when I ordered this since it was not cheap and had no idea how good ( or bad ) the cashews would be ... < br / > < br / > The order came in pretty fast - like 3 days . The cashews were fresh and whole - with like 10 broken pieces . They were in 2 5lb bags sealed with clear tape .. first I found it odd but then it turned out to be a good deal ; considering the second pack stayed fresh till I opened them . The trick is to actually keep them in an air-tight box so that they stay fresh longer . < br / > < br / > The only negative I can think of is that the price went up abt $ 5.00 for the 10lb since I bought them . These nuts arrived fresh and are very tasty . They are not broken or dirty looking like cashews sometimes can . I bought these for my boyfriend who really likes honey roasted pecans in salads that I have at a couple of restaurants . Plus , he likes nuts , pecans , almonds peanuts . He loved these . I actually ordered 3 cans instead of the gift tin , so he could take one to work , or his place , and stay fresh longer . Although I don\\'t think freshness will be an issue , they won\\'t last long ... lol My cat will go for a day , probably longer , haven\\'t tryed it , but he\\'ll walk right by this stuff every time , even when I know he\\'s hungery . ABSOLUTELY NO INTEREST . I swear he\\'d rather die of starvation then even take a wiff of it ! ! Got this free with another order I placed . I couldn\\'t believe how much the cats loved it . I will buy again for sure . This is a great ham soup base . I have used it in Ham and beans and seasoned greenbeans . Great flavor I haven\\'t used the ham base . It is loaded with MSG . I did not realize this when I ordered it and can not return it because it is a food item Before I discover this mix on Amazon I always bought it in Whole Food Store . < br / > I like this mix and when I am doing the pancakes they came very delicious and fluffy . < br / > Just one small secret : Try to add the Seltzer water instead of regular one . I appreciate the fact that I can buy this product online and have free shipping . This is a great all around mix that is very good with a wonderful texture . Thanks again amazon . Arrowhead Mills Buttermilk Pancake mix is my favorite mix . It tastes great , cooks up light and fluffy and is super easy to make . Although it can be made using water , I think it\\'s better made with milk . I love it with pure organic maple syrup . The pancakes taste great without any recipe adjustments for my son\\'s egg allergy . It\\'s also great for camping or any time you\\'d like to be able to make pancakes without having fresh eggs available . HEY ! These are GREAT Waffles and Pancakes ! We have to add 50 % more mix , tho , as the recipies on the bag are VERY thin . But we have a lot of fun with this Arrowhead Mills Buttermilk Pancake & Waffle Mix ! We serve them \" as is \" with fried eggs and REAL maple syrup , < a href = \" http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002483TSQ \" > Butternut Mountain Farm Vermont Pure Maple Syrup , Grade A Dark Amber , 1 Pint Jug </a> , or with warm strawberry jam and whipped cream , or Cool Whip , or add brown sugar to the mix to change the flavor and make a crispy waffle , or add 1/4 cup sugar and 1/4 cup malted milk powder < a href = \" http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ4HVC \" > Carnation Malted Milk , Original , 13 - Ounce Jars ( Pack of 3 ) </a> , for awesome gourmet pancakes and waffles like they serve at the Hilton ! Its handy to have extra bags on hand , too , and you cant beat the Subscribe and save price . This mix is 70 % ORGANIC , too ! We are glad we found this mix as we make pancakes without eggs for my son who has an allergy . < br / > They taste fine for our family - we like them many ways ! I love the flour however Amazon sent it with a book which broke a bag and made a mess . Customer sevice took care of the problem however it was a foolish way to ship the product . This mix is very poorly packaged and breaks open easily during shipping . Nearly a full bag of my order was spilled in the shipping box . 3 bags out of 4 had come unsealed at the top . There were no tears in the packages . Just awful ! I thought food was supposed to taste good ! I had to eat ice cream afterwards to get the taste out of my mouth , it\\'s that bad . Perhaps the worst bottle of wine I\\'ve ever had . I\\'m not even sure I would cook with this . It is thin , no body , and a transparent color not characteristic of a good pinot . The taste is just bitter - not the complexity that I expect from a pinot noir of any price . Just not what I\\'m looking for even in a low to mid price pinot noir . Maybe my bottle wasn\\'t sealed well and went to vinegar - other reviews for this wine are favorable . A good tasting light chip that has some value in nutrition . Everyone get the munchies ... is this is a good alternative to eating potato chips ! This is a wonderful warm flavored tea , especially now in colder weather . < br / > This tea has a sweet , soothing chamomile fragrance . It is subtle and sweet.It \\' s one of the better chamomile teas . < br / > If you find it hard to sleep at times , a cup of this sweet chamomile tea may help . < br / > If you really like sweet taste try Bigelow Chamomile Mango Herbal Tea . < br / > I highly recommend both . This is one of the best mint chocolate syrup I\\'ve ever had so far . The others pale in flavor by comparison . There are only seven ingredients in this sauce , including organic natural mint flavor . In the past I used ice cream heavy with other flavors like butterscotch , chocolate chips , Oreo cookies , caramel et al , because the mint flavor of other mint chocolate sauces was too pale . Now I buy plain vanilla or chocolate ice cream and the minty flavor of the Santa Cruz Organic Mint Chocolate syrup really stands out but doesn\\'t overpower the flavor of the ice cream . There are only 110 calories . And because the mint flavor is very apparent to my taste , I use it sparingly , so this 15.5 oz container last a bit longer than the other syrups I used . This is a simple product and it is simply good . There are no extra ingredients that are hard to pronounce and have you scouring the internet finding out what they are . It is a bit thinner consistency than the usual syrup , so use caution the first time you go to squeeze some out . This will be great for people who like mint , it has a much stronger mint flavor than chocolate . I use it in my coffee with a bit of half and half , tastes great . Sometimes simple is better . A grande item ! Delicious fish with the ultimate flavor , best ever in a can for all purposes ! I sent a case to my Mother recently diagnosed with Diabetes , and she loves it as a main entree for cooking patties ! I ordered this product at the same time as the Kirkland Signature salmon . The Raincoast Trading Co . salmon is very tasty , equally as good quality salmon as the Kirkland . However , the Raincoast arrived in perfect condition , the Kirkland cans were dented badly . I recommend this product to anyone who likes boneless skinless canned salmon . This tea tastes almost as good as the tea you would get at an Indian restaurant . It\\'s much better than getting a teabag and making it the English way , with a lot of water and a bit of milk . This is very creamy and tasty . My only criticism is that there aren\\'t enough sachets in the box . Only 10 . Since the directions say that you use one sachet for 100ml of water ( approximately half a cup ) , it\\'s not enough for a good cup of tea , so I use two . That means that one box is only good enough for five cups of tea . But it\\'s a delicious after-dinner drink ! I would buy this again if there were more sachets in a box . i love this product cant find it locally . Sometimes little out of the way stores have it.But i also love the chicken , pork chop bags.Every store i go in i look for them the lastplace i found it was at a meat market . This is the best way to cook a roast . Our local grocery went out of buisness and so I could not find this product till I looked here . Please continue to keep this product available ! It\\'s always a pleasure to find French\\'s products on the web . All of the markets in my area have made a bargain to carry nothing but McCormacks bland and tasteless seasonings . < br / > < br / > This is the most flavorful cooking bag mix you will ever find . If you like Oreo\\'s or the Oreo cakester , then you\\'ve got to try the Double Stuff cakesters ! ! ! These are the best ! ! Side note : shipping was very slow , but maybe your chances will be better . I was surprised about how good this was my family and friends laughed when I told them I bought this . But out of the can ready mix with a little salt , pepper , spinach , and some cheese and it\\'s a great easy meal ! The thing about Marmite is that those who don\\'t like it hate it , and those who love it can\\'t live without it . It\\'s very much \" an English thing \" and the language has even adopted the trade name as a metaphor ( as in \" Victoria Beckham is Marmite \" meaning that those who don\\'t like her ... etc . ) . Amazon has done the world a favor by making this weird and wonderful stuff available at an affordable price . Last time I looked , it was $ 25 a 500g jar in British stores in L.A.County , or about 4x what it costs in England . The Amazon supplier was quick and efficient , and I now have enough Marmite to last me to the end of the year ( or would have , if I didn\\'t decide to send one of the two jars to my son in Japan ! ) . Good job , Amazon ! A vile , miserable pancake . I put these in front of my toddler one morning and she actually cried . I don\\'t know if it was their flat and anemic appearance or their salty bitter taste . Only the whole wheat flour is organic in this mix . The buttermilk , baking soda ( SLS ) and sea salt are not . I am going back to Nature\\'s Path Buttermilk pancake mix . This one went straight into the garbage . Whats there to say about a fantastic chocolate chip cookie ! The only thing that could be improved is if they offered a bushel box of these so you would not run out so fast . Hope these don\\'t go the way of the dinosaur ! These arrived on time and packaged in green plastic wrap . The cookies were as fresh as the boxes found in the local grocery store . < br / > < br / > I have no complaints but I also now have no more cookies . We ate them all ! I was not expecting to like these cookies as much as I do . I like chocolate chip cookies well enough , but I really prefer a soft cookie to crisp ones . I have to say these Famous Amos cookies have pertty much turned me around . The cookies are rich and have that depth of flavor that comes from quality ingredients . The chips are real chocolate and melt redilly in your mouth creating a moist experience while chewing . These are truly great cookies . They aren\\'t fattening and they\\'re good for you , right ? That\\'s what I heard , at least , from an admittedly unreliable person . Great if you are cutting back on fat , they do resemble regular chips but are nothing like them . Extremely dry and hard . I have never met a Kettle brand chip I did not like . These chips have a great loaded potato flavor , which are flavorful . I like the sweet onion chips better , but these are also at the top of the list for great-tasting potato chips . Kettle chips are great chips f / the money ! After buying bags one at a time ( at a hefty markup ) at nearby stores , I decided to try bulk ordering some snack foods on Amazon . I was very pleased with the price and the products . < br / > < br / > These jalapeno kettle chips are not overly spicy ; they have a slow-building spice that starts very subtly a grows if you eat the whole bag , which I\\'m embarrassed to say I did quite a few times . < br / > < br / > The chips arrived well-packed and fresh . They had nearly a year of time before they expired , which is pretty impressive for chips . < br / > < br / > Most importantly , the price-per-bag was much , MUCH better than any local store could do , although I live near an expensive city , so that may play a role in the price difference . < br / > < br / > I wouldn\\'t hesitate to order another box of these once I run out . I buy mostly for vending , so the size of the bag is important . Kettle\\'s 1 oz bag is a good size although it seems a bit less than full . Salt & Vinegar flavor is satisfying , about an 8 out of 10 . Glad to find these in a one ounce size but the bag seems a bit less than full . It\\'s hard to find single serving chip bags that vend well . Sometimes they are too wide . or too plump with air . Bag size is good . BBQ flavor is about an 8 out of 10 . one of the best chips that you can buy ... and i\\'ve tried all the kettle varieties , and many others . There\\'s only a slight taste of jalapeno , and they are delicious . Perfect with a sandwich or alone . < br / > If you like being addicted , these are the chip for you . ... See you at addicts anonymous ... The title says it all . Great flavor , hint of spice , excellent crunch . We eat Kettle chips by the truck load at my house , we like all the flavors but this one far and away is our favorite , never enough bags to get us to our next shipment . I just wish Amazon could get the larger bags on subscribe and save ! If you buy these make sure you have enough for everyone otherwise you may not get enough for yourself ! ! ! WOW ! I have eaten quite a few potato chips in my day . Kettle chips are the BEST non-baked chips I have eaten . I decided to try the sweet onion chips , since I\\'ve never had them . I now have a FAVORITE ! ! If you like onions , this is a MUST buy ! I will definitely reorder these , as I mentioned above , they are the BEST I have ever eaten ! The flavor is GREAT . I cannot say how much I love Kettle brand potato chips . Kettle brand has a large variety of unique flavors , and the quality of the chips themselves blows all other potato chips out of the water . The ingredients list is printed on each bag and the only thing really bad for it is the oil they are frying the chips in . I love that these aren\\'t filled with nasty chemicals . I ordered the cheddar and sour cream krinkle cut ones which are great but I was torn between the < a href = \" http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0048IFUSC \" > Kettle Brand Potato Chips Fully Loaded Baked Potato , 2 - Ounce ( Pack of 24 ) </a> and the Jalapeno flavor . While I know the jalapeno flavor is good but this is way better . They include liquid smoke instead of actual bacon which I\\'m fine with since I\\'ve a vegetarian . I ordered this to give to guests coming from out of town for my wedding this spring and I can\\'t guarantee how many I will have left . My fiance and I love these . The packaging is perfect for anyone who is giving these to kids to take for school lunches , or handing out in gift bags , even just for portion control . Now , I haven\\'t done a side-by-side comparison , but these chips still taste like the real deal . These snack sized bags do as well as the regular brand at the grocery store I work for . Portion control AND reduced fat ? Yes , please ! With the Subscribe & Save these are much cheaper than at the grocery store . I love Kettle Brand Chips ! < br / > I\\'ve been in love with the Honey Dijon for years and decided to try out their other flavors . < br / > < br / > Sea Salt & Vinegar Chips are TANGY , SOUR , and make my lips pucker when I eat too many at a time . I got 12 big bags for a steal from amazon ( $ 11 WHAT ? ! ? ) . < br / > < br / > Personally , the flavor is too much for me , but my mom & aunt LOVE them and they hate potato chips . These chips are thick and crunchy . I absolutely love them . The taste is perfect . I like to buy these smaller bags because I cant trust myself with a large bag of these because they taste no good . I enjoy these chips . I got these instead of my usual jalapeno ones from the same company for a bit of flavor change . I think those are better but only slightly , like the jalapenos there is a great amount of flavor without being too overpowering . The small bag size prevents you from overeating as with a larger bag . I love these chips , I buy the 24 pack once a month . The bags are just the right size for snacking and prevent me from eating way too much with the larger bags . The jalapeno spice is subtle enough not to be overpowering but still gives you a great amount of flavor . These are the strongest tasting salt and vinegar chips I\\'ve had . I could still do with more vinegar flavor , but I think this is as close as I\\'m going to get without dousing them with vinegar powder myself . < br / > < br / > I did a side by side with the Cape Cod salt and vinegar and these are about twice as flavorful . Additionally , as other reviewers have said , they have quite a good bit of potassium in them ( somewhere in the neighbor of 15 % RDA per serving ) . I have been ordering the sea salt chips for about a year . I love them , but my daughter picked some of these up at our local grocery store and now they are my new favorite.Will be ordering them . These are my favorite gluten-free dairy-free flavored chips . Many other salt and vinegar chips contain dairy so it\\'s nice to find ones that I can eat . The vinegar flavor is really intense and good . These Kettle Brand potato chips in the Spicy Thai flavor really do taste like food I have eaten at a Thai restaurant . The ingredients listed include garlic powder , onion powder , parsley , jalapeno , and \" spices . \" I\\'m not sure what other spices there are , but it sure tastes like lemongrass to me ... yum . These chips are thick cut and very crunch . They come in a seriously heavy-duty bag . I tried to open it like I do regular chip bags by pulling the two sides apart ; no way ! The bag is so thick I wondered if it was plastic . I started looking for the scissors and decided that any company that put their chips in a bag this nice must have provided a way to open it . Sure enough , there is a small slit on the top and the simple directions \" tear here . \" So easy . Why didn\\'t I think of that . Honey Dijon flavor : okay flavor , but both my girlfriend and I thought they left a bad aftertaste . The aftertaste is sort of like old cheese ( presumably some folks like this ... I\\'m not a fancy cheese eater ) , and it lingers for at least an hour . I\\'d give this flavor a rating of 2 stars out of 5 . < br / > < br / > We have also tried the NY Cheddar flavor ( 4 stars ) , which we both liked better , and they didn\\'t leave any long-lingering or bad aftertaste . < br / > < br / > I\\'d give the consistency of the chips 4 stars . The chips are crunchy , but also greasy enough that I keep a napkin near or wash my hands after eating Kettle Chips . For me , Kettle is the best brand on the market . They really know how to turn the humble potato into something fit for the gods ! I didn\\'t think anything could top their salt and pepper chips , but these are my new favorite . The flavors are pure and real . They go great with just about everything and are highly addictive ! I hope they come out with a low fat version ; their low fat chips are excellent but they need more flavors . Salt and vinegar chips are definitely my favorite type of any potato chip . These ones made by Kettle were very tasty and I enjoyed them thoroughly . I just wish there was a more healthy option with the same great taste . What I like about them : < br / > 1 ) Very thick chips . < br / > 2 ) No trans fat and all natural , according to the info on the bag . < br / > 3 ) Flavor , but that\\'s a subjective thing . < br / > 4 ) 2oz bags , which keep you from eating too much at one time . Just set a limit of 1 bag . < br / > < br / > Cons : < br / > As another reviewer said , there\\'s a lot of oil in them chips . What I do is place a paper napkin on a plate and pour the chips on them . Wait a few mins before eating and the napkin will soak some of the oil off . It seems gross that there is so much oil on the chip that a napkin will soak it off , but it\\'s true ! And at least this way , you\\'ll get rid of some of the oil . These are so tangy it prevents me from eating too many , a handful or two does the trick . Very crisp and savory . I usually love Kettle Chips , and love salt & vinegar , but these chips were way too vinegary for me ! They do have the typical kettle chip crunch , but are too aggressively flavored for my taste . I have always been a fan of Kettle chips . When you open a bag of Kettle chips you know you are going to get quality . These chips are no exception and live up to the name printed on the package . < br / > < br / > The New York Cheddar chips have a very subtle flavor to them . You can taste the cheddar in them ; but it doesn\\'t smack you in the face like supermarket brand chips might . The taste lingers as well which is a definite plus ! < br / > < br / > Another aspect about these Kettle chips is the fact every chip is nice and crisp , that crunch in your mouth . On top of that there are no burnt chips in any of the bags I have had since the purchase . The only negative I might have is that the flavoring of the chips is uneven . Some chips might pack a nice cheddar punch while another might taste rather plain . This isn\\'t a big flaw as it happens when getting seasoned and doesn\\'t ruin the bag at all . < br / > < br / > Overall the quality of the chips is fantastic . The flavor is great and you wont \\' be disappointed , especially if you are a cheddar lover ! Tried many varieties of BBQ chips and hands down these are the BEST on the market ! These R not too salty or greasy . Great crispy crunch . Plenty of good BBQ flavor with a hint of sweetness that all other brands fall short of . Every bag ( after bag ) is just as mouth wateringly delicious as the 1st ! ! Kettle chis are the best ever ! These used to be my favorite flavor until I tried their Salt and Pepper kind but I\\'m sure this is just a personal preference . < br / > < br / > Crunchy , real potato chips ! These chips have the right amount of crunch and I enjoy the taste . Chips are consistent and have a fairly even distribution of seasoning . I like the 2 - oz size bags , just the right amount of chips . I subscribed to these - one case every three months . That comes out to about $ 5 a month for the convenience of having my favorite chips handy whenever I want . Because it seems Frito-Lay has managed to crowd out every other chip vendor from pretty much all my local stores this is the best way to ensure a steady supply of the items I want rather than the items Frito-Lay wants me to have . The two ounce bags are larger than you might be used to buying at the Subway ( for example ) which I find works very well - they\\'re large enough to be a good snack on their own , or you can even share a single bag over lunch . The size is perfect for ensuring these fantastically crunchy chips are always fresh - no chip clip needed ! < br / > < br / > The only problem ? I subscribed to four cases a year and having these yummy chips always in the pantry makes it really easy to increase ones Kettle chip consumption . Definitely have to hide the case from the kids ! OK , I did read the reviews which ranged from splendid to awful . I took the plunge as I do like salty , and tangy flavors . No , I had never had these before I took the leap and ordered a case at a super price . They arrived quickly and in great shape with the sell by date FEB 2011 . Umm , I\\'m in the middle on these chips , they are OK but not something I can\\'t live without . I love the crunch , the color , NO TRANS FAT . They are a little too vinegary for my taste , which is a lot coming from a kid that grew up eating pickled hard-boiled eggs and pickled pigs feet . < br / > < br / > I haven\\'t tried them with a deli sandwich and a cold mug of beer which might improve the experience :) This was the best deal ever . The delivery was fast , the chips are delicious and very fresh . Love it :) My husband and I LOVE these chips ! Personally I think the flavor is perfect . Try them for yourself ! The barbeque flavor of these chips is really perfect ! Just spicy enough , a hint of sweetness , just a little smokey . The chips themselves are extra crunchy and just thick enough to be substantial , but not hard . This makes for a wonderful snack or a great accompaniment for burgers , hot dogs or brats , chicken or just about any casual entree . I was hesitant to buy this at my local grocery store , Lunds , but they were on sale , so I bought a bag . I\\'ve found that going beyond the simply-flavored chips , like cheddar or vinegar , usually results in disappointment . Tried the Thai or asian-inspired chips by Target , Archer Farms , and they were awful . These Kettle Spicy Thai chips are just awesome ... so much so , that I\\'m considering buying them in bulk from Amazon . The taste is complicated and stimulates different parts of the palate . The taste sensations prevalent in real Thai food is baked into this chip ... sweet , salty , spicy . Was sour in there too ? I don\\'t know , but this is a well-made well-balanced chip that is addicting . As a professional potato chip muncher , I see these as thee very BEST on the market . Rich taste and flavor ! ! Almost impossible not to finish the entire bag.The true meaning of decadence ! These are hands-down the absolute best Salt & Vinegar chips you can buy . They have a great , strong flavor that has left me addicted . These are certainly my favorite chips . I highly recommend trying them ! Oh , I love these chips ! And they\\'re so hard to find where I am , and when I do find them , they\\'re usually $ 1-2 more per bag for less . Great that these are so cheap here at Amazon . I LOVE these chips ! It is a little weird to review potato chips . But these chips are great . The crunch is just right , plus they have just the right amount of salt . Not to salty not too bland . They are a little oily but that\\'s ok . The best thing is the 2 oz package . When I buy a larger bag it\\'s harder to resist eating them all . This 2 oz package allows for a little \" portion control \" . Be sure to use your scissors to open , \\' cause these chips are packaged for freshness and don\\'t open easily . Enjoy ! In the past couple years I have eaten and reviewed several kinds and styles of chips , from the best I\\'ve ever had to big disappointments . If you have eaten the LantChips varieties , there is no way that they are not the best as a group ; the Kettle chips are rightly salted and I was so irritated by some Pringles products . Kettle has good flavor but the small size and overwhelming oiliness takes away from the flavors . All in all , its good to have choice--Amazon does not stock the LantChips all the time so there are some days that there is no choice . these chips are good , and bad , and create moral dilemmas constantly . If wou are strong at will , or having a large BBQ go for it , but as for me , i was in the habit of bringing a new bag to work every three days , had to put in a lot of time on the treadmill to make up for it . BEWARE Kettle Chips flavors can be hit or miss . Some of their flavors are terrible . But this is very simple and delicious . Probably one of their best flavors . < br / > < br / > Pros : Thick , crunchy potato chips with light salt that doesn\\'t compromise on taste , eco-friendly business that isn\\'t just giving us lip service < br / > < br / > Cons : The occasional burnt chip and the bag is a pain to open . They have a tab that you can pull down but most of the time I end up tearing down the entire side of the bag . Use scissors instead . We bought these chips at a little sandwich shop in Sonoma while we were on vacation . I wasn\\'t sure what to expect by the package , and at first bite I didn\\'t know what to think ... and then all of the flavors hit ! < br / > Yum ! They are a bit spicy , but nothing overpowering . Just lots of crunchy , sweet , spicy goodness . They aren\\'t sold everywhere though , I\\'m still trying to find them somewhere close to where I live . I have to admit that those chips are so good that they are highly addictive . I can\\'t stop eating them ! ! ! It\\'s crunchy and seasoned at the right amount of flavor and salt . Just perfect ! ! ! Believe me , some chips are so salty , I can\\'t finish a small bag . But this one ... I just keep on eating ! These are some of the best chips that I have ever had ... They sure beat anything else out there and are even cooked in a way that is better for you than most other name brands . They are tangy and crisp and satisfy any craving at the time ! These will be the only chips that I buy from now on and I thank amazon for letting me buy them online in bulk and save some money at the same time ! I\\'m addicted to salty and tangy flavors , so when I opened my first bag of Sea Salt & Vinegar Kettle Brand chips I knew I had a perfect complement to my vegetable trays of cucumber , carrot , celery and cherry tomatoes . Skip the dip ; balance the tangy chips by alternating bites of raw vegetable . < br / > < br / > As an Oregonian , I\\'m proud to share these delectable snacks with friends , especially those living outside our state and who haven\\'t experienced gourmet chips .

Other brands I\\'ve tried use too much mustard flavor , which overpowers the Honey Dijon pairing . < br / > < br / > These chips make a great side dish on a BBQ plate with baked beans , coleslaw or potato salad and grilled meat .

They are by far the tastiest chips I\\'ve had and it\\'s impossible to walk past the aisle without picking up the trademark blue bag and then putting the bag clip on the bag ! These are by far my favorite chips , they are extremely crunchy ( similar to other Kettle style chips ) , but it\\'s the extreme Vinegar flavor that differentiates these from lesser fried potato snacks . I\\'ve tried several other brands of Salt and Vinegar and none of them come close . They are good but need more cheese and wish they were krinkle cut . I much prefer the salt & pepper just for the krinkle cut - they have a better texture . All around this brand is much better than Frito-Lay and a good price on Amazon when you get free shipping . These are similar to Tim\\'s or Zack\\'s chips in that they are very crispy . < br / > < br / > On a side note , these are the hardest bags to open by hand . I have to use a knife or scissors everytime . It took a while to get used to these chips but they are pretty good and more healthy for you . They sure were eaten all up by my family and friends . These are delicious . The 2 oz bags are a bit big for school lunches , definitely more than a serving . I recently tried this flavor / brand and was surprised at how delicious these chips are . The best thing was that there were a lot of \" brown \" chips in the bsg ( my favorite ) , so I bought some more through amazon and shared with family and friends . I am a little disappointed that there are not , so far , very many brown chips in these bags , but the flavor is still very good . I like them better than the yogurt and green onion flavor because they do not seem to be as salty , and the onion flavor is better . If you haven\\'t eaten Kettle chips before , I recommend that you try a bag before buying bulk . They are thicker and crunchier than Lays but just as fresh out of the bag . We are always pleased with Amazon\\'s packaging . Chips are never crushed or broken , always fresh . We really liked this brand / flavor of chips . Very tasty ! These chips are some of the best I\\'ve tasted . They are not filled with chemicals . You taste the tangy vinegar as well as the potato . Not greasy . Perfectly crispy . If you don\\'t like salt and vinegar tanginess , don\\'t even bother to try . These definitely have zip . I love them . My children and their friends love them . Even my 4 year old loves them ! These chips were a great deal . Kettle was having a special deal for the case of chips . They are hard to find in Vegas and are my favorite flavor . Shipping was very fast , sooner than expected . fantastic ! you can not beat this taste and you can not resist to it only one if you are spice lover Eat at your own risk . Once I would open a bag I could not stop . Good and salty . I don\\'t eat many chips , but these I love . Great buy and arrived quick and packed great . Expiration date is a ways away , so I have awhile to enjoy them Great natural potato flavor . I love brown russet , hardy flavor and these fit that description to a tee . I simply fell in love with these chips and refused to share them with my friends . :) ) My experience with a lot of cheese-favored chips has been too salty and a little over the greasy side . But these NY Cheddar from Kettle really changed my mind . Thanks to Amazon for great discounts and I don\\'t have to buy them from the store anymore . Bought this box of chips as a Father\\'s Day gift because Dad loves them . They are very yummy and more substantial than regular chips . These chips are quite tasty and the price is right . Packaged very well , would buy again . I like Kettle chips but was really disappointed with this order because they were over cooked . I bought a bigger sized bag from Costco and the chips were all cooked perfectly . So I don\\'t know why these were different . < br / > Will never buy these chips from here again . For some reason Amazon would not ship these to Alaska ! .. so I sent them to my grandchildren who got to enjoy them . They are very good chips ! Amazon should rethink the shipping to Alaska thing . I would order groceries online . My husband likes these a lot . They are a bit different to get used to as they are less greasy and salty in taste than the usual chips you buy . They are more browner than I would like to see and the chips are pretty sturdy in texture . Not bad , though . Just takes getting used to eating chips better for your health . They do have about 1/2 the calories in fat , however . Just got this order and it is ok . A bit light on the cheddar flavoring and herb taste eludes me , if it is there . I really love Kettle brand chips , but these are rather disappointing . There is very little sour cream or onion flavor . I took one and said good Russet potato chip but I found that the flavoring was subtle for my taste , a bit oily and overcooked . It may be because I am use to eating their great tasting < a href = \" http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6Q4GM \" > Kettle Chips Spicy Thai , 2 - Ounce Bags ( Pack of 24 ) </a> . Or perhaps because all the chips in the bags I received were overcooked and that overpowered the seasoning . It is obvious the chips are flavored , but if I did not read the bag I would never have thought it had Cheddar flavor . And I love New York Cheddar . The flavoring included Parmesan , Cheddar , Blue Cheese , garlic and other spices . A good chip even when overcooked , but I do not plan to buy them again . I took one and said good Russet potato chip but where is the flavoring ? Then all of a sudden , within seconds , it spread to my senses and my taste buds were happy . As close to Thai food as a potato chip can get . These chips are spicy enough to satisfy that craving for spice and a hint of sweetness that makes them habit forming . The flavoring included garlic , ginger , jalapeno , cilantro and other spices , and it just felt great to eat these . I will buy these again . These were a treat . I agree with the other review , these chips are not for a sore mouth or tender gums . The chips are very hard and the taste is delightful if you enjoy the salt / vinegar combo . Unfortunately , every bag I received in that case was over cooked ! They were very dark and only a few golden brown chips in each bag . They definitely need to improve that ! We love Kettle Chips Lightly Salted and don\\'t feel guilty eating them ! We used to buy them at Whole Foods but buying from Amazon has saved us money . We have purchased at least 3 times and have been happy with the chips and the delivery . A friend of mine brought these into work with the claim , \" these will change your life ! \" While my life is fairly unchanged , I cannot get enough of these chips . . . . and I do not even like kettle chips . For the most part , I find Kettle Chips to be too thick and greasy , but the flavor of these chips is amazing ! The are the type of hot that is refreshing . If you do not enjoy spicy or hot things . . . try these anyway , they may convert you . But if you happen to , like me , there is no better sea salt and vinegar chip I\\'ve found in this country . These are the best potato chips I\\'ve ever tasted . It\\'s easy to go through half of a bag without stopping . The texture / crunchiness is just perfect , as is the salt and vinegar combination . I don\\'t know how they taste so much better than all of the other chips I\\'ve ever had , but they do . And , judging from the nutrition facts , they seem to be healthier , too . They\\'re somewhat fibrous and have a good bit of potassium and vitamin c , which could be because they don\\'t skin the potatoes and the chips are a bit thicker than normal . < br / > < br / > And if you like these , all of the Kettle chips are great . i rarely eat chips but i saw these and tried them . they are really amazing . i love cheddar too , but the chips are really thin and crunch and delicious flavor . i recommend them . This is easily the best potato chip that I have ever had . Look at the ingredients : Ginger and 3 types of hot pepper . How can you go wrong ? < br / > < br / > Obviously , not for you if you don\\'t like spicy food . But , if you DO like spicy food , you\\'ll probably love these . They have that hot-with-a-hint-of-sweetness flavor combo that is prevalent in a lot of Thai food . Kettle Chips Spicy Thai potato chips have the perfect amount of sweet , savory and spicy - - everything you\\'d want in a good meal or better yet ... a potato chip . Since these are kettle-cooked , the chips are uniquely shaped and are sometimes a bit over-browned . They are , however , sliced just perfectly , not too thick , not too thin , so you can actually get a great crunch with each bite without breaking a tooth off . The flavor is tremendous , although I wouldn\\'t describe it as Thai . It\\'s more of a vague , sweet and tangy flavor with a kick , and every now and then you get a great big hit of ginger . If you like any spice at all , these really are not overly spicy , so most people can handle them . The fact that these chips have absolutely no artificial ingredients or trans fat makes them a fabulous addition to any muncher\\'s snack cupboard . Okay , I should not eat potato chips , nor should anyone . < br / > But these are so spicy , I would find it hard to eat < br / > very many . That makes them an indulgence that < br / > rescues some people from overindulgence . I don\\'t write very many reviews but I have to say that Kettle Brand chips are the best I have ever tasted . Every flavor is dynamite . If you are feeling iffy about honey dijon , I would recommend cheddar beer , absolutely amazing . And they\\'re healthy ! ( besides a lil fat ) I have eaten a lot of chips in my day and Kettle takes the cake . Enjoy , and don\\'t eat them too fast .'"

if you must have your oatmeal but can only scrape together two or three minutes to prepare it  There is no escaping the fact  however  that even the best instant oatmeal is nowhere near as good as even a store brand of oatmeal requiring stovetop preparation  Still  the McCanns is as good as it gets for instant oatmeal  Its even better than the organic  allnatural brands I have tried  All the varieties in the McCanns variety pack taste good  It can be prepared in the microwave or by adding boiling water so it is convenient in the extreme when time is an issue   br    br   McCanns use of actual cane sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup helped me decide to buy this product  Real sugar tastes better and is not as harmful as the other stuff  One thing I do not like  though  is McCanns use of thickeners  Oats plus water plus heat should make a creamy  tasty oatmeal without the need for guar gum  But this is a convenience product  Maybe the guar gum is why  after sitting in the bowl a while  the instant McCanns becomes too thick and gluey  This is a good instant oatmeal from the best oatmeal brand  It uses cane sugar instead of high fructouse corn syrup  so not only does it have a better sweetness  but some doctors now say that this form of sugar is better for you  Great on a cold morning when you dont have time to make McCanns Steel Cut Oats  The apple cinnamon is the best but the maple and brown sugar or the regular are good too  Plus they dont require doctoring to actually tell the three flavors apart  Instant oatmeal can become soggy the minute the water hits the bowl  McCanns Instant Oatmeal holds its texture  has excellent flavor  and is good for you all at the same time  McCanns regular oat meal is excellent  too  but may take a bit longer to prepare than most have time for in the morning  This is the best instant brand Ive ever eaten  and a very close second to the noninstant variety   br    br   McCanns Instant Irish Oatmeal  Variety

for half an hour  to the sloth addled instant  which can be done in the microwave for under three minutes  Its all good  thats for sure  and the beauty of the instant variety is that it is available in different flavors as well as regular   br   This variety pack allows different tastes to be explored  as well as giving you a chance to experience the difference between McCanns and other wellknown oatmeals  What I personally like about McCanns is that it cooks up thicker and with more body than the top brand here in America  The Apples  Cinnamon  though  tends to be a little liquidy so you may want to experiment with the amount of water you add  In my 1300watt microwave the oatmeal cooks up in about one minute and twentyseven seconds  so you should also watch that to get a handle on how much time and water to use   br   The only bad thing   if you can consider it a bad thing   about this offering is that you have to buy in lot so youll end up with six tencount boxes  This is good if you have a whole family of oatmealeaters  but if youre a single person alone   well  love oatmeal  I have McCanns Oatmeal every morning and by ordering it from Amazon I am able to save almost  300 per box   br   It is a great product  Tastes great and very healthy McCanns Oatmeal is a good quality choice  Our favorite is the Apples and Cinnamon  but we find that none of these are overly sugary  For a good hot breakfast in 2 minutes  this is excellent  We really like the McCanns steel cut oats but find we dont cook it up too often   br   This tastes much better to me than the grocery store brands and is just as convenient   br   Anything that keeps me eating oatmeal regularly is a good thing  This seems a little more wholesome than some of the supermarket brands  but it is somewhat mushy and doesnt have quite as much flavor either  It didnt pass muster with my kids  so I probably wont buy it again  Good oatmeal  I like the apple cinnamon the best  Though I wouldnt follow the directions on the package since it always comes out too soupy for my taste  That could just be me since I like my oatmeal really thick to add some milk on top of  The flavors are good  However  I do not see any differce between this and Oaker Oats brand  they are both mushy  I really like the Maple and Brown Sugar flavor  The regular is fine with brown sugar added  The Apples and Cinnamon flavor is OK  This is a very quick  easy and satisfying breakfast and Ill order this brand again  but not the variety  Ill get all Maple and Brown Sugar  This is the same stuff you can buy at the big box stores  There is nothing healthy about it  It is just carbs and sugars  Save your money and get something that at least has some taste  This oatmeal is not good  Its mushy  soft  I dont like it  Quaker Oats is the way to go  Got a free package of these with a bottle of bloody mary mix I bought from the seller  and the advertising worked  lol  I tried them  and shared them with 2 buddies  and we all loved them  So im here to buy more  and noticed there were no reviews yet   well now there is  They are Hot  but not  burn your mouth forever hot  its a nice temp  Perfect for us  This wasnt in stock the last time I looked  I had to go to the Vermont Country Store in Weston to find it along with a jaw harp  Cranberry Horseradish Sauce  Fartless Black Bean Salsa  Apple Cider Jelly  Newtons Cradle Art in Motion and the staple Vermont Maple Syrup   br    br   Back to the Ass Kickin Peanuts  They are hot  They will activate the perspiration glands behind your ears and under your arms  It requires a beverage as advertised  a glass of very cold milk  and a box of Kleenex since it will make your nose run  They look like ordinary peanuts which is already giving me ideas for work  I suspect that some people have been hitting my goodies in my absence  especially my colleague Greg  Im going to take this to work at earliest opportunity and empty the contents of this can into an ordinary Planters Peanuts can  and then see whose crying or whose nose is running when I return   br    br   The can should be shaken to ensure the spices are evenly distributed  It is important to wash your hands after consumption and not touch the eyes   br    br   Youll go nuts over these AssKickin  Peanuts   br    br   P  S  Im not sharing the peanuts  not deliberately  and Ill probably give Greg the jaw harp for Christmas  Hell be so insulted  were used to spicy foods down here in south texas and these are not at all spicy  doubt very much habanero is used at all  could take it up a notch or two  I roast at home with a stovetop popcorn popper  but I do it outside  of course   These beans  Coffee Bean Direct Green Mexican Altura  seem to be wellsuited for this method  The first and second cracks are distinct  and Ive roasted the beans from medium to slightly dark with great results every time  The aroma is strong and persistent  The taste is smooth  velvety  yet lively  We roast these in a large cast iron pan on the grill  about 13 of the bag at a time   The smell is wonderful and the roasted beans taste delicious too  More importantly  the coffee is smooth  no bitter aftertaste  On numerous occasions  weve had to send the roasted beans home with friends because they like it so much  Deal was awesome  Arrived before Halloween as indicated and was enough to satisfy trick or treaters  I love the quality of this product and it was much less expensive than the local stores candy  It is chocolate  what can I say  Great variety of everything our family loves  With a family of six it goes fast here  Perfect variety  Kit Kat  Reeses  take five and more  Great product  nice combination of chocolates and perfect size  The bags had plenty  and they were shipped promptly  The kids in the neighborhood liked our candies  Halloween is over but  I sent a bag to my daughters class for her share  The chocolate was fresh and enjoyed by many  Watch your prices with this  While the assortment was good  and I did get this on a gold box purchase  the price for this was  br    34 less at Target  This bag of candy online is pretty expensive  it should be cheaper in order to compete with grocery stores  other than that  its a good combination of my favorite candy Arrived in 6 days and were so stale i could not eat any of the 6 bags   I have used the endurolyte product for several years in both pill and powder form  Long desert rides on the dirt bike always found my camelbak water heavily laced with the endurolyte powder  not overly tasty  but quite effective  as I never got a cramp on these several hundred mile rides  Same for desert racing in the buggy  the camelbaks were always laced with the powder  Now we have the Fizz  what a great product  Firstly  its Hammers endurolyte product so its great  endurance athletes the world over use their products  Second its convenient  handly tablets that dissovle in a fizz  Third it tastes great  Imagine getting a nice cool drink when your body is starving for hydration and electrolytes and rather than getting a  salty  taste  you get a refreshing lemonlime or mango  The camelbaks always get the Fizz now  I also drop a tablet in my bottled water whenever I exercise and have a nice flavored water chock full of electrolytes  I cannot recommend this product or any hammer product highly enough  This product serves me well as a source of electrolytes during and after a long run or bike ride   br   I have tried all of the flavors but really do like the grapefruit flavor  no aftertaste and I actually like the slight carbonation   br   I use other Hammer products and really like their whole product line  This stuff really works for preventing cramping during the middle to latter stages of your rides  Pop 1 into each water bottle and youre set  Flavor is fine and goes down easy  For those of us on a low carb diet these little tablets are just the thing   br    br   Two years ago I started cycling again after many years but was having heart arrhythmia after longer rides in high heat  I was drinking plain water but did a little research and thought electrolytes might be the issue  Gatorade wasnt an option because it is so loaded with carbohydrates so I looked around for a lowcarb alternative  The  zero carb  sports drinks didnt help so what to do  One day I ran across these at my bike shop so tried a tube of them  voila   problem solved    br    br   Ive shared them with two friends in particular whose problems with leg cramps were resolved while using these   br    br   These guys got it right   they are superbly formulated and simply work  I purchased the Mango flavor  and to me it doesnt take like Mango at all  There is no hint of sweetness  and unfortunately there is a hint or aftertaste almost like licorice  Ive been consuming various sports nutrition products for decades  so Im familiar and have come to like the taste of the most of the products Ive tried  The mango flavor is one of the least appealing Ive tasted  Its not terrible  but its bad enough that I notice the bad taste every sip I take  If youre impulsive like me  then  6 is ok  Dont get me wrong  the quality of these babies is very good and I have no complaints  But in retrospect  the price is a little ridiculous  esp  when you add on the shipping   this was sooooo deliscious but too bad i ate em too fast and gained 2 pds  my fault These Albanese gummi bears and rings and so on are very good and tasty and high quality  The bears even have little faces  At my local candy store this type of gummi stuff  bears  rings  snakes  balls  worms  whatever  are about  10  lb  These twin packs of 45 or 5 pound bags is a screaming deal as far as Im concerned  Im probably 50 pounds deep in these friggin  things  Consumed  Grape gummy bears are hard to find in my area  In fact pretty much anyone I talk to about grape gummy bears they think Im lying  So I bought 10lbs    These bears are a little bit bigger then the other brands and have kind of sour kick  but nothing to strong  I love grape flavored candy  soda and these are pretty good  There is another company that makes grape gummy bears that are a little bit better in my opinion  but these are well worth it for the price  I like to use the gummy bears in home made Popsicles with flavored sports drink  The salt in the sports drink makes for softer popsicles  and the gummy bears are awesome frozen  They are delicious  I ordered two of these and two of raspberry latice tarts directly from FantasiCakes website for a dinner party I was hosting  It arrived fresh and intact  Very good size  I froze half for later use  I am a pastry lover and these were the best Ive ever tasted  The pastry was soft  the jam was really good and the taste was great  They were gone in no time  My guests were really impressed  Buyer Beware Please  This sweetener is not for everybody  Maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body  You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience  Nausea  diarrhea  headaches can also be experienced  I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugarfree chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell  I thought Id found sugarfree chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in  The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before  I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping  As the symptoms passed  this too was very unpleasant  Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit  all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate  My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugarfree popcorn at my local market  The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy  new sugarfree treat taste so good  my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener  down to the very bottom of the label and read  maltitol  in tiny little letters  Thank goodness Id eaten only a little  I still ended up with all the same sideeffects but for a much shorter duration  Some people can use maltitol to their hearts content but others  like me  can have a bad reaction to it  In case youre like me   its not you  its the maltitol  It is okay  I would not go out of my way to buy it again No tea flavor at all  Just whole brunch of artifial flavors  It is not returnable  I wasted 20  bucks  These looked like a perfect snack to through in with my trail mix  Unfortunately  they arrived in a solid mass of melted chocolate  I left them in my pantry for a few days  and when I opened them at room temperature they were still gooey  I through them in the fridge and Ive been breaking off hunks ever since  They taste good to me  but the chocolate is all grainy after melting and then solidifying again  I wont order them online again  but if I see them in a store I would pick them up  These taste really good  I have been purchasing a different brand and these are very similar in taste and texture  I agree with the other reviewer regarding ordering in the summer  There is no insulating packaging with ice packs so they will melt in warm weather like all chocolate food items  Order in cold weather and buy enough to last    The taste was great  but the berries had melted  May order again in winter  If you order in cold weather you should enjoy flavor  i know i cannot make tea this good  granted  i am not from the south but i know i have never enjoyed tea that was this sweet without being too sweet  it tastes crisp  This peppermint stick is delicious and fun to eat  My dad got me one for Christmas because he remembered me having a similar one when I was a little girl  Im 30 now and I love it  Great gift for all ages  I purchased these giant canes before and the recipients loved them so much  they kept them and would not eat them  I know the product title says Molecular Gastronomy  but dont let that scare you off  I have been looking for this for a while now  not for food science  but for something more down to earth  I use it to make my own coffee creamer   br    br   I have to have my coffee blonde and sweet  but the flavored creamers are full of the bad kinds of fat  and honestly  I hate to use manufactured  food  items  I really dont think they are good for the body  On the other hand  I hate using cold milk or cream  because I like HOT coffee   br    br   I stumbled across this on Amazon one day and got the idea of making my own creamer  I also bought lowfat  noninstant  milk powder and regular milk powder  The noninstant lowfat milk is a little sweeter and tastes fresher than regular instant lowfat milk  but does not dissolve good in cold water  which is not a problem for hot coffee  You will have to play with the ratios  I would not do just the heavy cream  it made the coffee too rich  Also  I think the powder is too expensive to just use on its own  I like mixing 13 of each together   br    br   For flavoring  I bough cocoa bean powder  vanilla bean powder  and caster  superfine  sugar  I mix up small batches along with spices like cinnamon and nutmeg to make my own flavored creamers  If you wanted  you could use a fake sweetner powder instead  I make up small amounts that I store in jelly canning jars  I also use my little food chopper  food processor to blend everything  so the sugar is not heavier and sinks to the bottom  Let it settle for a bit before opening the top though   br    br   This stuff tastes WAY better than the storebought creamers and it is fun to experiment and come up with your own flavors  I am going to try using some essential oils next and see if I can get a good chocolate  orange mix   br    br   All of the ingredients I mentioned are here online  Take the time to experiment  Maybe you dont use any lowfat milk  Or dont add any flavorings  It is up to you  Also  would make great housewarming  host  ess  gifts   br    br   I am sure other molecular people will be able to tell you more of what you can do with it  and I am sure I will experiment with it in cooking  but the main reason I bought it was to make my own creamer and it worked out great  While my dogs like all of the flavors that we have tried of this dog food  for some reason their itching increased when I tried the lamb and rice  I have some very itchy dogs and am giving them a limited ingredient dog food to try to help  The duck and sweet potato cut down on the itching significantly  but when we tried lamb and rice they started itching more once again  I like Natural Balance for the quality ingredients  Awesome dog food  However  when given to my  Boston   who has severe reactions to some food ingredients  his itching increased to violent jumping out of bed at night  scratching  As soon as I changed to a different formula  the scratching stopped  So glad Natural Balance has other choices  I guess you have to try each  until you find whats best for your pet  We have three dogs and all of them love this food  We bought it specifically for one of our dogs who has food allergies and it works great for him  no more hot spots or tummy problems   br   I LOVE that it ships right to our door with free shipping  My dog has a ton of allergies both environmental and food  She was on a prescription dog food before we had her tested to see what allergies she has  After we got the test back  we learned she was allergic to something in the prescription brand  So I finally found this dog food and she has done so well on this  She still has her environmental triggers  but I am happy she can finally eat something I know wont cause her pain  My shepherd  collie mix has IBS  Our vet recommended a limited ingredient food  This has really helped her symptoms and she likes it  I will always buy it from Amazon  its  10 cheaper and free shipping  Natural Balance Dry Dog Food Lamb Meal and Brown Rice Recipe did wonders for my Jack Russell  She has awful food allergys and this food was our last hope because it was the last food we could find that didnt have SOMETHING in it that she was allergic to  She has no problem eating it dry but normally I mix the Natural Balance Dry Lamb and Brown Rice with the Natural Balance Wet Lamb and Brown Rice  she seems to like that better  We started feeding it to our other dog  a Bichon  too and she loves it  If your dog has allergys or stomach issue  or if you want your dog to eat better food   this is it  You will see a difference in your pet  Great food  I love the idea of one food for all ages  breeds  Ã \\x8e ts a real convenience as well as a really good product  My 3 dogs eat less  have almost no gas  their poop is regular and a perfect consistency  what else can a mom ask for   I have a standard poodle and pomeranian who both do wonderful on this food  I have switched them to a different food  due to price  a couple of times and end up going right back to natural balance  This is great dog food  my dog has severs allergies and this brand is the only one that we can feed him  This food is great  all ages dogs  I have a 3 year old and a puppy  They are both so soft and hardly ever get sick  The food is good especially when you have Amazon Prime shipping  My golden retriever is one of the most picky dogs Ive ever met  After experimenting with various types of food  I have found she loves natural balance  What I really like about natural balance is the fact that it has multiple flavors in dry and wet varieties  I mix her dry food with a little wet food and my golden loves it  Furthermore  I do like mixing up the flavors each time as I think the same meal day over day might get a little boring  so I figured why not  I tend to stay away from the fish type though as it smells   br    br   Additionally  I started purchasing off Amazon because Petco didnt have the wet food box and only had a couple of cans  I came home and to my surprise realized that I could save  20 each time I bought dog food if I just buy it off Amazon   br    br   All in all  I definitely recommend and give my stamp of approval to natural balance dog food  While I have never eaten it  my dog seems to love it  This is the same food we get at pet store  But its delivered to my door  And for the same price or slightly less  Ive been very pleased with the Natural Balance dog food  Our dogs have had issues with other dog foods in the past and I had someone recommend Natural Balance grain free since it is possible they were allergic to grains  Since switching I havent had any issues  It is also helpful that have have different kibble size for larger  smaller sized dogs  My 11  2 year old basenji  jack russell mix loves this dog food  Hes been noticeably healthier and more energetic since I switched him over from the standard dog foods earlier this year  Despite the higher cost of natural dog foods  I find that he eats significantly less of the Natural Balance dog foods and still stays happy and full  On the normal dog foods  hed eat up to 3 cups of dog food a day  the recommended serving for his size   whereas he only eats about 1 cup to 11  2 cup of the Natural Balance dog food a day  When you take this into account  youre actually getting more  bang for your buck  with the natural dog foods since you dont have to buy as much to last just as long as the normal dog foods  and a healthier  happier dog  to boot  Add in the fact that you can get free  2  day shipping with Amazon Prime  Im sold   Our pup has experienced allergies in forms of hotspots and itching from other dog foods  The cheap  you can buy it anywhere  food not only have crazy preservatives in them but can cause health problems for your pets  This food works wonders on reducing allergies and our dog loves the food   br   This message is RAMSEY FrAnkenSteiN approved  My English Bulldog had skin allergies the summer we got him at age 3  The vet recommended we wean him off the food his previous owner gave him  Iams Lamb and Rice  and onto a new kind  This was the second one we tried  and it has been working ever since  Its for dogs that need a limited diet who can be sensitive to additives and proteins commonly found in commercial dog food  like chicken or beef   I fed this to my Golden Retriever and he hated it  He wouldnt eat it  and when he did  it gave him terrible diarrhea  We will not be buying this again  Its also super expensive  The mouth says   How do I love thee  let me count the ways    br   If you like apple products a must have item  The only draw back  shipping cost  These are very heavy  Arrived slightly thawed  My parents wouldnt accept it  However  the company was very helpful and issued a full refund  The crust on these tarts are perfect  My husband loves these  but Im not so crazy about them  They are just too sour  tart for my taste  Ill eat the crust and hubby takes my filling  My kids think theyre great  so maybe its just me  These are absolutely scrumptuous  My husband and I both love them  however  as another customer put it  they are expensive to ship  The cost of shipping is more than the tartlets themselves are  What a nice alternative to an apple pie  Love the fact there was no slicing and dicing  Easy to prepare  I also loved the fact that you can make them fresh whenever needed  I like Creme Brulee  I loved that these were so easy  Just sprinkle on the sugar that came with and broil  They look amazing and taste great  My guess thought I really went out of the way for them when really it took all of 5 minutes  I will be ordering more  not what I was expecting in terms of the companys reputation for excellent home delivery products I first bought pickled asparagus at an Amish market and it was love at first bite  Hence  when I saw these on the discount rack at the local Safeway I cleaned it out  These are even better than the ones from the Amish market  They are fantastic  and some of the jars have a bonus clove of garlic at the bottom  Im going to order the six pack and Im a household of one  They wont go to waste  I love asparagus  Up until very recently  I had never had pickled asparagus  Oh my goodness  when a friend introduced me to this exact brand  I couldnt believe how great stuff tasted  I loved it so much I bought the six pack  Ive got 2 jars left  Gonna need more   Im presently on a diet and I was at my Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Grocery looking over possible diet foods  I wanted things that were tasty  nonfat and low in calories  I came home with about a dozen items  Thats how I discovered the Tillen Farms Pickled Crispy Asparagus  Well  Ive always liked asparagus anyway and Ive enjoyed several brands of pickled asparagus  This Tillen Farms brand is really  really good  Its the best I can recall  Theres an excellent flavor and a big clove of garlic down in the bottom of the jar which Im looking forward to eating  I cant believe how good this asparagus tastes and right on the front it says  only 60 calories per jar   Now this is my idea of a good diet food   br    br   Gary Peterson I was diappointed in the flavor and texture of this mix  I usually like most of the Low Carb things I have tried  but was diappointed in this specific one  I have been drinking this tea for a long time now  I used to have to purchase it at a doctors office because it wasnt available elsewhere  Im so glad that I can buy it now from Amazoncom  I drink this tea throughout the day like other folks drink coffee  Wonderful taste  I have been drinking Royal King 100  Natural Organic Green Tea  100 tea bags x 2g each  as my every day tea for several years now  I buy 12 boxes at a time to save on shipping  For many years I used to drink coffee from morning till night  But finally I realized that drinking so much coffee was not healthy for me  I finally resolved to improve my health and stopped drinking coffee all together  I tried many alternative drinks to replace my coffee habit  I found that green tea was not only good tasting it also has health benefits  Green tea is one of the few drinks that actually makes you healthier  coffe and other drinks do not   the only healthier drink is quality cold water  In my opinion  for the price  Royal King 100  Natural Organic Green Tea is one of the best tasting teas  This green tea has a beautiful golden color  the taste is bright and fresh  I recommend adding a tiny amount of Y  S  Organic Bee Farms RAW HONEY to the tea to add sweetness and health benefits too  I also give myself a treat once in a while by having a much more expense tea  Tribute Xi Hu Long Jing  but this fantastic tea is not practical for me to drink as my every day tea  although I would if I could afford it    br    br   Cons  On my latest shipment the package shown on the Amazon page is different than the one shipped  The one shipped displays  NATURALLY HIGH IN POLYPHENOL CATECHINS   a key contributive element to the possible health effects of tea   whereas the Amazon package displays  CAFFENE FREE   So I am not sure if this green tea is Caffene free or not  The other con is that sometimes the tea bag rips open when I unwrap the string from around the tea bag  So if the string seems stuck to the tea bag I put the bag in the hot water to unstick it  this has to be one of the best teas I have ever tasted  its clean  bright  fresh   br    br   great delivery  again quality  just try it  I love  love this green tea  It is very hard to find in our area and some places on the internet charge a big price and I usually dont get as many boxes as I did with this merchant  I will definitely order from this seller again   Thanks   I depend on my green tea fix everyday  I love this tea  It helps curb my eating during the day  My Mom and I have given it all friends to try  Im Italian and I lived in Italy for years  I used to buy these cookies for my everyday breakfast with an Italian espresso  I couldnt find them anywhere here in the Bay area  so its great to have them again  In the 1980s I spent several summers in Italy  This biscotti is often given as a breakfast food or midday snack  They are simple and delicious and were not sold in the US back then  They are so good that I brought back two bags from a recent trip to Italy  It is great to see that they may now be found on Amazon   br    br   Note  it is great to open a bag  smell the contents  pour a glass of milk  then dip the Macines in the milk  Great routine and treat for kids  I had heard a little about this product from the local pet store  then tried a small bag for our 2 cats of about 3 and 6 years respectively  The female  younger one took to it right away  and the older male  who was unfortunately weaned on the junk cat food with all the corn meal and etc  in it  and would usually refuse a diet change  actually liked it too  The older male is overweight and we were trying to switch him to soft food on the doctors request  but he totally refused it  He is a posh cat after all  He still consumes too many calories  the fatty  but at least I know hes eating good food  Of course  I know this product seems to cost more than most other feline food on the market  but I just cant see feeding our animals the lousy alternatives that are out there  marketed as being healthy  Why do commercials show cats eating a vegetarian diet which is mostly corn meal  Is that right  Ill stay with this for now  but stay tuned   br    br   Im updating this review after 9 months of using this cat food for our two cats  I upgraded the stars from 4 to 5 as it really has been a good food for the two of them  Garfield still eats a little too much  but hes just a big cat who doesnt exercise much  lets face it  Our female cat will be 4 years old in a couple months and shes so healthy  Shes tiny  but happy and agile  I tried the chicken version of Holistic Select  but Garfield seemd to miss this sardine version so we went back to this one  Ive ordered the duck version and will update this once they try it  I started buying this after I noticed my 1 year old cat was already starting to lose his  spunk  so I decided it was time to start buying him  real  cat food  not the garbage in the super markets  I found this at the pet store out of the other million choices  and Im sure there are other brands that are just as good but this is the one I went with to try first and it was a great purchase  My cat has been on this for the past 8 months and hes now just has active as he was when he was a kitten and his coat has became sooo soft  Mainly  he loved the taste even more  I highly recommend this brand to all my friends and family for their animals  I have done a lot of research to find the best food for my cat  and this is an excellent food  That is also according to my holistic veterinarian  They put probiotics on the kibble as the last step  which is very important to me  The best thing is that my cat loved it immediately and I had to stop mixing it with the old food because she only would eat Holistic Select  This cat food was recommended by my vet because my 13 year old Cleo Cat was having trouble keeping any food down and was loosing weight  It stopped her problems  She doesnt eat as much as before since she seems to be more satisfied after eating which helps justify the added price  It aids in digestion since the  ok sorry  smells are gone if ya know what I mean  Had to add that so anyone experiencing problems with their cats can see there are a lot of benifits from this cat food  I have a 4 year old male cat who has chronic urinary tract infections  I feed him this dry food in combination with wet food  with water added to it  and Uri Ease  The combination seems to keeps his UTIs under control  If I switch to another type of dry food  his UTI gets worse  The other cats seem to enjoy this food as well  Its expensive but it seems to be the best solution for me  Before I was educated about feline nutrition  I allowed my cats to become addicted to dry cat food  I always offered both canned and dry  but wish I would have fed them premium quality canned food and limited dry food  I have two 15 year old cats and two 5 year old cats  The only good quality dry foods they will eat are Wellness and Innova  Innovas manufacturer was recently purchased by Procter  Gamble  I began looking for a replacement  After once again offering several samples  from my local holistic pet store  Holistic Select was the only one  other than the usual Wellness and Innova  they would eat  For finicky cats  I recommend trying Holistic Select  It is a good quality food that is very palatable for finicky eaters  My holistic vet recommended this  along with a few other brands  We tried them all  but my cats prefer this  especially the sardine version   The best part is their coats are so soft and clean and their eyes are so clear  AND  and I dont want to be rude  so Ill say this as delicately as I can  their waste is far less odorous than cats who eat the McDonalds junk found in most stores  which is a definite plus for me  The health benefits are so obvious  I highly recommend Holistic Select  One of my cats is allergic to fish and beef  This formula is one of the few she can eat  and it has much better ingredients than the prescription diets available at the vet  Both of my kitties are very active  have soft shiny fur  and neither are fat  Dry food reduces tartar buildup on teeth  also  Our cats thrive extremely well on this dry cat food  They definitely have much less hair ball throw ups and their fur is great  They are fit and not over weight  This vendor ships extremely fast  Is one of the top Amazon suppliers in our book  Ive been a fan of Hot  Spicy Maruchan Ramen for a long time  If you enjoy spice  and love ramen  youll love this product  Too bad its way too expensive here on Amazon  Its only  336 per 12 at my Walmart  Ive been eating Ramen noodles since I was a little kid  and Ive never found a better flavor than Hot  Spicy Chicken  It isnt hot at all to a chilihead like me  but it sure is good  I LOVE spicy ramen  but for whatever reasons this thing burns my stomach badly and the burning sensation doesnt go away for like 3 hours  Not sure if that is healthy or not  and you can buy this at Walmart for  028  way cheaper than Amazon  Always being a fan of ramen as a quick and easy meal  finding it on amazon for a decent price and having it delivered to your door by the case is an amazing situation for anyone to find themselves in  I must be a bit of a wuss  because this soup tastes to me how I imagine fire might taste  Typically I like spicy food if it has a good flavor  I dont find this to be the case with this soup  Any flavor is killed off by the burn  I really loved the spicy flavor these had  I found myself liking the broth more than the noodles which is usually the opposite  If you arent used to the heat this might bother you and if you like hot hot foods this might not be enough  Got these on sale for roughly 25 cents per cup  which is half the price of my local grocery stores  plus they rarely stock the spicy flavors  These things are a GREAT snack for my office where time is constantly crunched and sometimes you cant escape for a real meal  This is one of my favorite flavors of Instant Lunch and will be back to buy every time it goes on sale  i have bought allot of different flavors and this happens to be one of my favorites and will be getting more soon I love this flavor of ramen  I dont eat other flavors anymore because they taste too bland by comparison  For the convenience of having it delivered to my home  I have prime  so I get it in two days and dont have to pay for the shipping   the price on amazon isnt bad at all  but it is still cheaper to run down and pick up a case of this at the grocery store  The BEST investment Ive ever made for ginger  Its unbelievable  Its fibrous like the real ginger  has that spicy kick to it  but its perfect with the sugar  calms it down  Its very worth the  40 for 5lbs of it  Ill be getting more soon  I use these as a topper for my ginger cupcakes and cookies  Delicious  I cannot get Australian ginger where I live  This compares favorably to Australian Ginger Ive purchased in other cities  Now I can enjoy it without traveling  I keep trying other brands  cheaper brands  Stupid me  This ginger IS soooo worth the money  Tender  moist and never a let down  My son has had acid reflux since birth and has been on every medication available with no improvement  Until an older gentleman came into his work place and told him about this product and I automatically ordered it for him  I was really not expecting any better results than the 1000 other things we have tried  What a surprise  He has not had any heartburn or symptoms since day 2 of starting eating one piece of this Ginger each morning  He can now eat anything and actually enjoy it  This product was a God send for him  Thank you all for it  I bought this for our office to give people something sweet to snack on  Because its bite size its easier for people to grab a couple a pieces rather than an entire licorice stick  My only complaint is that one of the bags broke open in shipping  Twizzlers brand licorice is much better than that other well known brand   br   If you can get these for  2 to  250 a package with free s  h its a good deal   br   The black and cherry have good taste  but the strawberry taste was too delicate and barely there I love these  very tasty    Infact  I think I am addicted to them   br   Buying them in packs of 6 bags  is very reasonable than going to Target and getting a bag  Savings are about a  100 a bag  I use subscribe and save on these and several other product  I love subscribe and save    If you are looking for a less messy version of licorice for the children  then be sure to try these  Theyre soft  easy to chew  and they dont get your hands all sticky and gross in the car  in the summer  at the beach  etc  We love all the flavos and sometimes mix these in with the chocolate to have a very nice snack  Great item  great price too  highly recommend  I might be mistaken  but it appears that the pieces in this bag were reduced in size  If they did do that  it was doubtlessly done to make it appear that the buyer got a better deal  having so many pieces after all  The problem is that the pieces have to be a certain size in order to have enough flavor for your eating experience  As it is  you have to use 2 or 3 pieces to match the old piece size  it is not the same  Being a fan of Newmans Pineapple salsa for quite a while  I was looking for a comparable salsa  This is one of the best tasting salsas Ive ever had  My daughters love it too  They dont like super chunky salsa and the Berry Mango has a nice smooth texture with small mango pieces  The salsa is not too sweet  just sweet enough and although its mild  it has a nice little kick to it  At this price  its a steal  The SALSA smelled delicious  as I think it probably was  but  unfortunately  the person  at AMAZON  that is a packer  there is probably several  had very little  stuffing  to work with  especially on the bottoms  Therefore  the bottoms were broken on all three bottles  As I reached for my computer  I was told NO RETURNS  cause its a food item   I then looked for a CUSTOMER SERVICE tag  and I found  none  on their NEW FACE LIFT  THEY SEEM TO BE PROUD OF THEIR NEW FACE LIFT BUT  THEY SHOULD AT LEAST HAVE A PLACE TO CONTACT THEM IN EMERGENCIES  LIKE  I BUY A LOT OF  STUFF  AND IT ALL COMES IN STYROFOAM BOXES  NEVER WOULD I SHIP THINGS  br   ESPECIALLY SALSA  IN A CARDBOARD BOX WITH JUST A STRIPE OF LARGE BUBBLE WRAP ON IT  NO MATTER HOW MUCH THE CARRIER  FED EX  IS CAREFUL  ITS GOING TO BREAK SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE  ESPECIALLY IN AN ALL GLASS CONTAINER  BARBARA L  S  This is one of the best salsas that I have found in a long time but stay away from the variety pack  The other two that come with it are not worth your money  These remind me of dog treats I made once using pumpkin and cinnamon  Theyre kind of bland and not my favorite Back To Nature product  But my finace really loves them so thats where the three stars come from  This is the best cornmeal  I made regular cornbread and hot water cornbread with this meal and both were outstanding  Also fried some oysters with this meal  it gave them a great texture and flovor  This is a fabulous marinade  I love to use it for chicken  either baked in the oven OR on the grill  This has enough flavor  flair  Ive even used it for dinner parties  only to receive rave reviews from my guests   DEFINITELY worth the price  Super cheap and super easy  Love it  Works with chicken fish beef or pork  Fast easy and makes it taste excellent  Plus buying in bulk is more than 50  off from box stores Got this for my brother who is on Jorge Cruise diet and decided to try one for myself  It actually tastes pretty good  These singles sell for  250   336 at the store for 1 box of 24 singles  Im not sure why Amazon is selling it for  999 for a box of 24 singles  Hazelnut coffee creamer is my favorite  but truly this is not a good buy  AWESOME    such a yummy flavor I got it as a healthy alternative to the desserts we normally eat and I am so glad that I did there are so many things you can do with Jello desserts and still have them taste good and be good for you  I will definitentally be purchasing this product again the flavor was so wonderful  I went to 4 grocery stores looking for this flavor of Jello for my green tomato jam recipe and finally found it here  This jello is wonderful  Evidently its only carried in the stores during the summer but with harvest time in the Fall  I couldnt find it anywhere in town  This Jello tastes like watermelon and the jam recipe I made with it takes like watermelon jam  Great made as regular Jello too  Yummy  What a deal this is the healthiest salt you can use  This box should last our family the year no problem  Iodized sea salt will not raise your blood pressure as regular salt will  Perfect size sea salt for the table or the picnic basket  We love it  Shakes well  no clumping and flows freely   span class   tiny   Length  026 Mins  br    br   span The expiration date is 21 months from the day I bought this product  The tuna  tomato combination is delicious  This is one of the many items I reorder on Amazon every month or so   br   edit  added a short video  so you see what this combination looks like   br    br   I was wearing one of those headlamps  but I didnt do a good job focusing on the tuna   br   I should film it over  but it doesnt look like many people view this product anyway  Ive never heard of the SAFCOL brand before but I was tired of only trying the typical pouches  Starkist and Chicken of the Sea  I was really surprised as I thought it was a bit better than the other brands and with less seasoning  these are the best tasting tuna pack they make in my opinion  make a great on the go snack  and really satisfying with the tomato I have always purchased StarKist tuna but thought I would try this brand for a change of pace  The taste of the tuna was not pleasant  too much basil and other spices for me  Im not familiar with the Safcol brand but being a tuna addict  gave this a shot  The tuna tastes like its good quality but I found the tomato basil flavor to be a bit bland  Its better than something plain but it didnt pack the punch I was hoping for  Its still a great option for a low calorie  low fat meal  I found it much tastier than the plain tuna pouches out there  Excellent quality  and no need to  dress it up    br    br   I put it the micro on about 20  power for 1 minute and Shazam   br    br   I believe a little heating brings out the flavor  Seriously this product was as tasteless as they come  There are much better tasting products out there but at 100 calories its better than a special k bar or cookie snack pack  You just have to season it or combine it with something else to share the flavor  I read about pomegranate molasses so I had to try it  I havent made anything with it yet  just eaten a little bit at a time but WOW is it decadent  Its dark  syrupy  sour  and a little sweet  A dab of this and I forget about dessert  Its just a really unique flavor with a pleasing metallic undertone  Yum   Im going to try making fesenjan next  Used this in Moroccan recipes  as a syrup in a brilliant mixed beverage and as a swirled topping on sliced oranges soaked in orange water  Wonderful  wonderful stuff  I dont know how long these sat on the back of a shelf somewhere  but they were so old that they wouldnt cook  I had to throw half of them out  because the skins were damaged  a clear sign of dried beans past their prime  I cant even return these or ask for a refund  because food is not returnable  Will find a different brand to use  For now  I have about fifty servings of beans to throw away  Besides being smaller than runts  they look the same and have the same consistency  Unfortunately  they taste nothing like banana runts  nor do they even taste good  Yucky stuff  Trying to return with vendor  The item over all was fine  but the Banana Heads are not just like Banana Runts they are alot smaller  Also when I received the item  the packaging was not great  The Banana Heads had come open during shipping and were all over the packing envelope  I purchased as a giveaway for a baby shower with Jungle theme  They worked out perfect for 25 small bags of candy  I purchased 5   If you want more than 25 small bags  I would purchase a larger bag  I have drunk Ricore since my mother allowed be to drink caffeine  I love this stuff in milk   br   Its much smoother and tastier than instant coffee with milk  I am French and live in the US   br   and bring back boxes of Ricore at every opportunity  Savora is another hidden gem you can bring  br   back  Check it out  I first had this drink when my mother brought it back with her from a visit to her home in Brittany France and thought it was delicious  I wish it were a bit cheaper but other than that  I love this product  I couldnt wait to try the 8 ″ Cinnamon Coffee Cake because it is made with fresh eggs  creamy sour cream  Madagascar Bourbon Vanilla and is topped and filled with cinnamon streusel  This 8 ″ Cinnamon Coffee Cake is available online for only  1895  Now  I have had my fair share of cinnamon coffee cakes  but  let me just tell you that the FantasiCakes Cinnamon Coffee Cake really  takes the cake  with size  price  quality and taste   br   The cake arrived very fast and was carefully packaged so that it arrived in almost perfect condition  It also comes with a large tub of white icing that you can drizzle over the top  before serving  I couldnt believe how large the size was and it actually fed my family of 5 for us to enjoy during breakfast  for three days  The cake itself is thick and almost has a solid but sponge cake type consistency that is really moist and very filling  The flavors are to die for with the sticky cinnamon outside and sweet cinnamon and vanilla swirled throughout the inside of the cake  The icing really tops it off beautifully and gives it that moist and sticky sweet flavor  Pair the cake with your morning coffee and youve got the perfect breakfast treat  I used to love these growing up and stopped drinking water and lemon juice from this brand about 56 years ago  This stuff used to be so strong i used to just pour some in my mouth and get that alive feeling going  It feels like the product went through changes which added more water or something to make it not so strong  The stronger it is the less you use as well  The product is still really good but the taste is the same quality as the cheaper brand names almost  I thought these would go fast but hey all lemon stuff i love unless it goes bad  This is a good product just wish it still had that hit me in the mouth chug sensation it used to be like  One of the best lemon juice that I have tried  I am recurring customer due to the high quality of this product  When the season for fresh lemos is out  this one supplement our need for the citrus on the kitchen or refreshments   br    br   I will continue buying it  This lemon juice is a must in my kitchen yearround  It has a powerful flavor and you dont need much of it to zest up a dish  I add a spritz of it to my water nearly every day   br    br   I will buy this product again and again  Fast delivery and good product  This is the same lemon juice concentrate you can find in stores and its really handy to have around to add to sauces  dressings  etc  Such a pain to squeeze fresh juice everytime you need it  nevermind having the lemons on hand to begin with  This is not as good as the Frozen Lemon juice  but it is good  It has a slightly odd flavor  perhaps from a preservative  Sure wish I could order the frozen juice  Couldnt believe it when told how relaxing this beverage was  Seriously  drink it only if you are getting ready for a nap or bedtime  If you have plans to drive or perform any other activity not recommended   br    br   I feel my arms and legs almost tingle with relaxation  After a short time my eyes start to get droopy and I am in another place   br    br   Love this stuff  I bought these at Grocery Outlet here in the Seattle Tacoma are for  400 a case of tweleve not paying  3800 Yes 3 for a dollar  I like the taste not great but not bad either low calorie will buy more but not at this whacked out price  This is an great product  The taste is great  and it works exactly as described  Superb natural sleep aid  AMAZING  WE have been looking for  natural  ways to help us sleep since we always seem to be overloaded with stress and a busy schedule  Yes  wed probably be better served taking a yoga class  but this is a good second choice  This helps you fall asleep and stay asleep  I drank half the first night and that was plenty for me  After about 30 minutes  I was ready for bed  I woke up refreshed and with no sleepydrug hangover  so that is a huge bonus   br    br   I gave the product 3 stars  instead of the 5 it deserves  as their packing job was marginal at best  The product arrived with 2 broken bottles  which at this price is a  6 loss  The bottles are glass and all they did was wrap one layer of the smallbubbled bubble wrap around the case and placed it in a larger box with extra room to move around in that box  Big packing fail  but the product is awesome  We made chocolate chip cookies with BRM Garbanzo Bean Flour and the results were fantastic  The brown sugar and chocolate mask any bean taste that other reviews have mentioned  Our friends couldnt discern any difference from classic CCCs  The texture  body  and elasticity  meaning reduced tendency to fall apart that occurs with most other glutenfree flours  is nice and chewy   the same as CCCs made with regular flour  And an added bonus   the high protein and fiber level  I calculate 23 g fiber  cookie  fills you up so that you are satisfied with smaller servings and the glycemic index is significantly lower   br    br   I highly recommend this flour even if CCCs are the only thing you make with it  This is great stuff  Made some really tasty banana bread  Good quality and lowest price in town  We had trouble finding this locally  delivery was fast  no more hunting up and down the flour aisle at our local grocery stores  This packet of glaze is the secret to making those European style fresh fruit tarts  I am about to make one for a pie auction at church  after a friend requested that something  strawberry  should be offered  You can make the most amazing and relatively  healthy  fruit tarts by baking a base  layering it with uncooked  fresh  sliced fruit  then pouring over the madeup contents of one of these packets  They harden up at room temperature  hold the fruit together so you can slice the tart  and they let the beauty of the arranged fruit show through  Ive also seen this glaze used over cheesecakes  to hold a fruit topping in place  Personally  I do not like cheesecake  too rich for me  but a fruit glazed cheesecake is gorgeous  I will admit  To do this  slice fruit and layer it on the cheesecake while its still in the springform pan  Pour on the glaze  let it set up and then remove the springform  Youll have a clear layer of fruit on top of the cheesecake  Cherries  strawberries or sliced mangos are nice  but the best one I ever had used thin slices of lemons  that had been gently poached in sugar syrup before they were layered on the cake   br    br   I use a base of sponge cake  baked in a shallow form  but other bases can be pate sucre  a kind of French pastry that is a bit like a sugar cookie  that works well in those fluted  straightsided forms  You can also make minitarts in a muffin pan  prebaking each mold with a layer of pie crust  even commercial crust works  though again  I prefer pate sucre  it holds its shape better and is more substantial and has a better crumb   Just blindbake the muffin tins lined with pate  then pop them out and fill with fresh fruits  berries are great  and pour over the glaze  Some people put a layer of creme patisserie  which is a pastry cream like custard but stabilized with flour  below the fruit and I happen to think these taste best   br    br   If you get into baking  this glaze is a musthave on the shelf  The ingredients are vegan  tapioca starch  carrageenan  dextrose  cream of tartar  locust bean gum  so if you are looking to make a vegan tofu cheesecake  you can use this on top  as well as use it for fruit tarts with a nut crust base  My Scotties were full of hot spots and when I used this within a week all the hot spots were gone  The smell is kinda strong  but not bad  Its tolerablel  I bought this coffee because its much cheaper than the ganocafe and has the organic reishi mushroom as well as other healthy antioxidants  I didnt expect it to taste good  but it actually does  Ive only had it for a few days and for  5 its totally worth it  My sisters all take ganocafe but now Im introducing them to this less expensive similar coffee  I will follow up on this product in a few weeks   The coffee is very finely processed and the flavor is just alright  Nescafe and Mount Hagen are better  I bought this to try something other than these two  but I probably wont get this again  There is just a slight  vitaminy  taste  but its not overwhelming  Its also a bit pricey for what you get  This coffee is great because its all organic ingredients  No pesticides to worry about  plus it tastes good  and you have the healing effects for ganoderma  Like the other people mentioned  this coffee has a great taste  Ive tried different instant coffees before  but this one is one of the better ones  Another one of my favorites  if you want to try it out  though NOT organic   is  Africafe pure instant coffee  Tastes great  and gives me energy without the jitters  Love this product   br   However  I do wish it came in some sort of resealable jar or hard plastic container instead of a ziplock pouch because the ziplock ripped off and quit working after awhile  But the product is fantastic  just not crazy about the packaging  These little guys are tasty and refreshing   br    br   I usually eat salads for lunch which can do terrible things to breath  I eat 2 of these after lunch  because they are so small  and I find this sufficiently resolves the problem   br    br   Theyre sugar free  sugar can actually help the smelly bacteria grow  which is great and theyre tasty enough that I almost think of them as part of my lunch   br    br   This is a good bulk value buy and Id highly recommend the mints themselves  Cheers  I like these better than the regular Altoids  but theyre even more costly  so youd better like them  These little tins of sugar free mine mints were a great dealThere perfict for on the goFifty mints per tin is just the right amount to cary alongAnd there safer for your teeth than the ones with sugarThe price of twelve dollars was very resonableAlso there great for shareingIf you are looking for a mint try these onesYoull be glad you did  Pros   br    packaging  shipping  price  br    sold about a year before its expiration date  enough for me to eat  share 9 boxes   br    not too  fresh  like the regular wintergreen and not in a powdery form  its a real mint   br    br   Cons  none  Be careful not to eat too many of them in one day  as one of the chemicals in it is the same as that of a LAXATIVE    LOLOLOL    These mints are really strong and have a great taste  They are also a convenient size to carry in a pocket or purse  This is a huge supply of them  Im still working on these and have plenty to spare  Much more effective than buying one from the grocery store or 711 every time you want a mint  Even with small containers  they dont fill them up  These little tins are less than half filled and at the price charged it seems a ripoff  Is there some exotic ingredient as costly as gold contained in those tiny squares  Or how about the cereal ploy  they were filled at the factory but settled in transport   br   Can manufacturers be honest in their dealings  I love  and use the empty containers for medicine  advil in my purse  desk  suitcase  Also line with felt to keep earrings  Perfect little size to disguise small valuables when traveling and LOVE the mints  Tiny and powerful without burning my mouth  Received as shown  My mother in law likes these and Walgreens quit carrying them  It was great i could get them on Amazon  I keep a case of these in my office and always have at least a tin or two on my desk for visitors to help themselves to  Some folks stop by just to grab some mints and others pop them like candy while we meet  When I find someone who keeps coming back for more I just give them their own tin  One coworker asked me to save the tins for her so she could use them as pillboxes and safety pin boxes  Like I said  theyre a real hit  Since I wouldnt be able to keep my hands off a candy dish  this is a good alternative to have around and its nice to have them around if I have garlic for lunch  I gave the item 4 stars because they arent as tasty as the sugar version of the mints but what sugar free item is as good as its full sugar counterpart   and because of the fact that each tin is wrapped in plastic which seems like a waste and is irritating to remove  although I totally get why they wrap it  it still doesnt make it easy to deal with   The tiny Altoids are great for a quick breath freshening and the small box is great for portability  Its full  but compact   br    br   I havent run out yet  and probably wont for a couple months  but I cant wait to buy it again  I loved these Wintergreen Altoid Smalls so much  I had to come write a review  The packaging is small for convenience  and the Altoids are smaller as well with a square shape  blue hue  and even more delicious taste in my opinion  I definitely prefer them over the regularsize Altoids and will continue purchasing them  Highly recommended  Fresh scent and taste  Easy to eat one tin in few hours  I use them as favors and everyone loved them  Hard to find the wintergreen smalls  sugar free  as stores only have the red smalls  peppermint   such a common flavor   The wintergreen is refreshing and absolutely delicious  Driving cross country  if someone cuts me off  I turn to my daughter with my hand out and say  Wintergreen Me   She pulls one out  puts it in my hand  and all is right with the world  To me  these are nothing like the regular Altoids and are not breath mints  They are pleasanttasting little candies in a cute convenient tin  and thats as far as it goes  The mintiness is just not strong  and the wintergreens are definitely weaker than the peppermint minis  Im not a dragonbreath person  but still  one of these mints is too small to have any effect on my breath  Four or five will freshen my breath for a short while  maybe 15 minutes  At this point  I think the Icebreakers Frost mints are the best as sugar free breath mints  we have fed our cats a lot of stuff  These 2 boy cats are not picky eaters  They loved the Purina  They loved the Nutro  They loved the Iams  They love whatever we feed them   br    br   This review is based on what we  their affectionate owners love  After a certain age  we were instructed by the vet to consider senior foods  and lower carb foods  because the catties were fatties  We tried a few types of food  Some evinced no change  Some made the litter superstink  Some had too small a kibble and the cats barfed it up because they didnt have to chew it to swallow it   br    br   This Felidae has done the trick  No problems to speak of  It is consistent in the litter and bearable on the nose  The cats love it  The kibble is sized appropriate to chewing  And heres the kicker   br   After feeding the cats Felidae  their demeanor improved  Their coats are super soft and lush  both are new improvements we can directly attribute to this food  Were now loyal Felidae consumers   br    br   Additionally  the absence of corn product in the feed seems to lessen or remove the reactions of our friends with catallergies  I started my cat on Felidae Platinum about 3 weeks ago and she loves it  Shes an older cat  somewhat overweight  and had a grouchy temperament  I first mixed it with her previous food and she figured out which was which   she ate the Felidae and left the old food  Shes now been on just the Felidae for about ten days now  off the old food entirely  and she is a much sweeter  happier cat  I think it must agree with her better or be more easily digested  or something  In any case  I am a happy purchaser of Felidae  I dont agree with the previous reviewer that cats dont like it  Clearly  mine does  We have three cats  the youngest is about eleven years old  another is fifteen and our oldest is  well ancient  That is what the vet told us ten years ago  The youngest is a blob  When he lays down  he looks like a footstool  The other two are arthritic and skinny   br    br   Since we had such success with Canidae Platinum for senior dogs  I figured that wed give it a try for our cats  Id had them on low ash Purina One Urinary tract formula for their entire lives and thankfully we had no UT problems   br    br   Buster  the youngest  is still a blob after six months plus on Felidae for Senior and Overweight cats  However  the other two are now much more active and we can tell that they are really  feeling better  since we changed their food to Felidae  Even Prissy  the ancient one has started to play and tease the dogs by getting them to chase her  where before when she was on Purina One  all she wanted to do was to sleep   br    br   I think that if you can get your cat on this fairly early in their weight problems  itll be more effective   br    br   However  the glucosamine will certainly help your older fur balls have a happier life  Too much of a good thing  We worked this kibble in over time  slowly shifting the percentage of Felidae to national junkfood brand until the bowl was all natural  By this time  the cats couldnt keep it in or down  What a mess  Weve moved on  As with canidae  Felidae has also changed their formula  Cats do not like change when it comes to their food  And they just had to change it without putting it on their label  We noticed the color of the food had changed and so did the smell   As you will notice I have also reviewd the Canidae  and this all happened the same time the dogs were having issues    br    br   Prior to the change in food we had almost lost two of our cats because we had moved to a new home  If cats get  upset  because of a change in enviorment  or a loud noise they can stop eating  It depends on the cat  Two of them had stopped eating and had lost a lot of weight  We took them to the vet and it took months to get them back to normal  It has been a year since then and they are better  Then the formula for this food changed   br    br   We started to noitce they were not eating as much and it started to bug us  We asked the shop owner of the feed store and she had no knowledge of any change to the food  It wasnt until the we were in there with other customers yelling about their dogs food making their dogs sick  Right away we changed the cats food and they started chowing down and havent suffered one bit like our dogs have   br    br   Cats are sensitve animals and changes to thier food could cause them to stop eating  Anyone thinking of purchasing this food should not do it  We have 5 rescued and fixed cats  none of which are picky eaters and the change in this formula could have been the death of them had we not found out about the change in their formula   br    br   I urge anyone that has had these problems to go to the consumer affairs website and also the FDA website and write a letter to them to let them know how this has affected your animal  As with canidae they do not care how the change has affected my animals  and tell me not to buy it  This is just horrible  Dont buy just a few of these  I order these by the case  I cant even remember the first time I tasted an anchovy stuffed olive but I have tried several of the brands online and this brand is my favorite  I order these olives a lot  They are unlike any other olives out there  The subtle flavors of the brine go great with cheeses  One of my favorite appetizer treats for guests  Hey  the description says 360 grams  that is roughly 13 ounces at under  400 per can  No way  that is the approximate price for a 100 gram can  My husband and I are both kind of wimpy when it comes to hot things and this seasoning is just a bit too spicy for us  It definitely makes you sweat a bit when youre eating it  It was still edible to us by adding a good sized dollop of sour cream but I dont think I would buy it again due to the heat  We prefer the milder McCormicks brand of Fajita mix  Ive also had fajitas in a couple of different restaurants and it wasnt as spicy as this mix is   br    br   If you like super spicy then this is not burning hot so you might want to keep that in mind  To me it was more than medium hot but not by too much   br    br   I gave it three stars because it was pretty easy to make and its versatile in that you could vary the veggies you put in it  You take a plastic bag  a couple of tbs of vegetable oil  14 cup water and mix the seasoning  water and oil together then add the chicken strips to the bag and let it marinate for 5 minutes  In the meantime  it says to stir fry your veggies  peppers and onion  but I found it easier to just cook the chicken and veggies together and I dont think it affected quality or taste  I also used extra virgin olive oil rather than vegetable oil   br    br   I have one more package of this to use and next time Im going to add more veggies and maybe some chopped tomato to cut the heat a bit more  A friend whod been drinking tea for 80 of his 84 years introduced me to this tea a few months ago  Even took me over to the store and bought me a pound  At  7  lb  in a retail store or a little over  9 with shipping from an online merchant  I think its great  Ive been drinking Earl Grey  English Breakfast  Irish Breakfast  Lapsang Souchong  Assam  etc  Most of them were over  30  lb  with shipping  Aside from the Lapsang Souchong  I think this is a great replacement for all the rest  Has everything Im looking for in a strong  fullbodied black tea with enough character to keep it from becoming boring  My current favorite afternoon tea  Unless youre extremely jaded or a tea snob  youll love it  I love strong  full bodied quality tea and typically drink assam  irish breakfast or early grey tea  but as the other reviewer noted the price per pound can be discouraging  So I have been searching for a quality full bodied tea that wasnt bitter at a more palatable price point  and this certainly fits the bill  And unlike some other teas where they tend to be better in one form or another  i  e  iced vs  hot  this tea is excellent in both forms  I would certainly recommend this to anyone who prefers that smooth full bodied quality tea that doesnt cost an arm and leg  I drink this tea plain  without sugar or milk   and it has a pleasant aroma   br    br   The price from Amazon is cheaper than my local grocery store  One reviewer is right  I think it has some herbal smell to make up the aroma  So the label  Imperial Blend  kind of implied the herb   br    br   I am not exactly a black tea drinker  so this tea is a surprise  and affordable too  I usually prefer White Chinese tea  like White Peony  but it is more expensive  and requires lower temperature water  But this is black tea  and this aroma kind of remind me the  softness  of white tea  Ive tried a variety of Ahmad tea  Not because I particularly like this brand  but they are just easier to come across  The Imperial blend  I believe  is the most complex yet well balanced of all the ones Ive tried  Its full body like a good cup of Assam  which by no means overpower the delightful  clean taste of Darjeerling  complete with a long lasting note of bergamot  I enjoy it best in the evening  It gives a satisfying and relaxing finish to a busy day   br    br   For those interested in the specifics  I use about 3 teaspoons of lose tea in a stainless steel infuser in a 16 oz mug  let it steep in 208F water for 23 min  take the infuser out  and drink it without sugar or milk to savor its sophistication  I have tried literally dozens of teas since being introduced to the Russian custom of preparing and drinking tea  and the Ahmad Imperial blend is probably my favorite of all of these due to the fact that it is equally delicious hot or iced  I buy the threepacks as needed from Amazon and go through them rapidly  My family loves it and my friends have it in their homes now too  try one box of it and you will love it too  This is an excellent tea  One of the best I have ever had  It is especially great when you prepare it with a samovar  Herbal additives in this blend destroy real tea taste  It is only for people who like herbal taste  I dont  Makes a tasty  super easy meal  fast  BUT high in calories   br    br   The instructions say to saute the veggies first but I recommend cooking the chicken first  The chicken takes longer to cook and the raw chicken ontop of veggies just makes a slimy mess  I made it with snow peas and carrots only  I dont like the little corn  Added some red pepper flakes for heat and served ontop of rice  It came out wonderful  Dinner on the table in less than 30mins  I think I have tried just about every Bloody Mary mixer on the market at one time or the other  Most have too much sugar or worst  corn syrup  This mixer is all natural ingredients and very tasty  It does have a little kick  Enjoy  Might be a little spicy for some  but this stuff rocks  I use 12 and 12 with V8 for a milder version  or the best is a Bloody Caesar   br   Half mix  half clamato  Took me one or two to get used to the pickle taste  But now aim hooked and have to keep a bottle on hand This candy is not as described  The middle is almost hard it is not a silky or smooth filling as described   br   Looks and tastes like its way past its expiration date   br   Would never reccommend this  Paid a good chunk of cash for nothing I started drinking the power slim tea when I was on the HCG diet to help curb cravings  Since I liked it so well  I tried some of the others and I am now hooked  They are so satisfying that I drink them all the time  The Energy gives you that extra pickmeup in the afternoons that helps keep me going all day  no matter how long  Im trying several of the Wu Yi teas  I like this one particularly because of the subtle citrus taste  It also has a natural sweetness   br    br   The ingredients include Organic WuLi Cliff Oolong Tea  700 mg   Organic Black Tea  600 mg   Organic Green Tea Extract  100 mg   Proprietary blend  600 mg   plus some Ginseng  panax   Orange Peel  Lemon Grass  and Guarana  Other Ingredients  Natual Orange and Citrus flavors   br    br   My goal is to drink more tea and less coffee  I am enjoying trying a different kind of tea every day  Ill be coming back to this one  i cannot live without this citron falksalt  it is wonderful on watermelon  fish  almost any food requiring salt and in my world it all does  just try it on red juicy watermelon  wonderful experience  Terrible  Artificial lemon taste  like Pledge Lemon Furniture Polish  Dont do this to yourself  Just use plain flake salt and some fresh grated lemon zest  These things are huge  I love the way the crystals crunch  and the flavor is not too overpowering or too subtle  This lemony flavor is my favoriteits good on almost everything  Youll have plenty of flavored salt for a long time if you buy this  The taste of these white cheddar flat breads is like a regular cracker  which is not bad  except that I bought them because I wanted a cheese taste   br    br   What was a HUGE disappointment  How misleading the packaging of the box is  The photo on the box  I bought these in store  makes it look like it is full of long flatbreads  expanding the length and width of the box   Wrong  The plastic tray that holds the crackers is about 2  smaller all around  leaving you with about 15 or so small flatbreads   br    br   What is also bad about this is that the company states they use biodegradable and ecofriendly packaging  FAIL  They used a HUGE box for a ridiculously small amount of crackers  Not ecofriendly at all   br    br   Would I buy these again  No  I feel ripped off  The other crackers  like Sesame Tarragon  give you a little  br   more bang for your buck and have more flavor  This is the ultimate puppy food  The kibbles are great for small breeds  High in digestible nutrients as opposed to fillers some companies use  Less waste results from the high quality ingredients  I have been hunting  training  showing and handling various breeds of dogs for nearly 40 years  with multiple National Champions  I have been highly satisfied with Eukanubas quality and the results I have obtained feeding their foods  My recent purchases are with WAG  through AMAZONcom  Their prices are the best I have found and they are very good at shipping immediately on items in stock  The recommendation when we bought our puppies  lhasa  bichon mix and lhasa  poodle mix  was that we continue them on the food that they have had since being weaned  This is a somewhat expensive food so I cant say that we were terribly pleased but we loaded up on the stuff and headed home   br    br   Let me just say this  I have had small dogs before  Never have I seen such gas issues  Both of them consistently had foul gas  Consistently  Usually when theyre sitting on our laps but  you know  Theyre dogs   br    br   When we got through the first bag of this stuff  we purchased more on amazon  It was a great price for it since we got a 40 lb bag for the price of  I think  a 15 lb bag at Petco  But  they continued to have gas  I mean  they loved the food  dont get me wrong and they loved it more when wed mix in some water and it would be like soft food  Somehow that made their gas worse but I think Ill have to give that responsible to the speed with which they chowed down  cant blame the food itself for gluttony   br    br   Eventually  we switched their food  No more farting  I think it was due to the high fat content which undoubtedly is necessary for very small puppies  They just need that in their diet  I think that we were advised to keep them on it for much longer than was useful  they said up until 1 year   Yeah right  you try dealing with gas for that long  Around 6 mos of age we switched to PuppyChow  Much better  Granted  they dont like it as much  but we humans like it a whole lot better  A very delicate green tea with a smooth light taste and an subtle floral tones and no bitter aftertaste   br    br   In the 20  years we have been drinking Ahmad teas not even once have we been disappointed  The superb quality of Ahmad teas has remained consistent throughout the years   br    br   I am so happy to find Ahmad teas available here  thanks Amazon   because only a few stores carry it in my area and they are quite a few miles away  The current deal for the pack of 6 is superb  much cheaper than I can find locally    br    br   This is a great tasting tea  which I am happy to recommend  Fresh  a great way to get a little chocolate in my life without a million calories  They taste just like chocolate pudding  If you like the Ceylon tea variety  you will certainly enjoy and appreciate this tea   br    br   I am so happy to find Ahmad teas available here  thanks Amazon   and very surprised at the negative review from 2009 because in the 20  years we have been drinking Ahmad teas not even once have we been disappointed  The superb quality of Ahmad teas has remained consistent throughout the years   br    br   The current deal for the pack of 4 is very good  cheaper than I can find locally    br    br   Highly recommended   br    br   NOTE  This listings description is confusing  Each packet of tea weighs 500 grams  which equals 11 pounds or 176 ounces  Ive been enjoying this tea for years  This tea is good mornings  afternoons or evenings  My local store went out of buisiness  Thanks Amazon  I use a bodum tea press to prepare a pot  Hi  I have to have black tea everyday  I have done it in the past 25 years and its a habit of mine  Ahmad tea is one of my favorite brands and I highly recommend it if you like black tea  I think this is going to remain my favorite for the next 100 years or so  I have tried it out despite the other review and I found that this is exactly the same tea i buy in either Russian or Italian groceries  Ahmad Tea is an excellent looseleaf tea eith hot or for making iced tea  Great flavor with no lingering aftertaste  Ive been drinking this tea for the past 8 or 10 years  usually buying a box or two when visiting large metropolitan areas  where many MiddleEastern stores carry loose Ahmad teas  usually at  57 for a pound box  Ive always considered it an unremarkable but robust tea  with enough aroma and taste  and beautiful reddish color  perhaps not good enough a tea to drink on its own  but a decent base for mixes   br   This tea  however  is nothing of the sort  Freshly opened package has almost no characteristic tea smell  and the brewed tea is weak  flat and tasteless  Somehow it just does not seem to be the same product anymore  So  you get a lot of tea for the money  but the quality is such that you might as well drink Lipton bags  they are not that much worse  I love love love this deal  its way fun to pick from so many  Teas and chocolates and ciders as well as many coffees  The other outfits that assemble samplers are boring  they do the choosing  and from a much narrower range  The sellers here are very nice  also  and will answer questions via email about the slightly confusing ordering method  its easy   If you want great packaging  forget it  they ship fast  and the kups are just tossed loose in a box  Who cares  Once youve tried some random sampler packs  and now are overloaded with decafs  extra bolds  or teas   this is a great way to get exactly the brands or style that you want  Received the order in a couple of days and was exactly what I ordered  This was my second order and Ill be ordering this item again  good products and fast shipping equals a happy me  a little pricey but you can hand pick a few good flavors  a few i cant find anywhere else so def worth the price If used on a daily basis you will keep your gums healty and between your teeth clean and free of plack  WOW  This product is very impressive  I bought the 8oz blueberry and was pleased with packaging  price and shipping  The powder dissolves instantly  Even in water  Ive just been mixing a 14 tsp in a small glass of water for now and drinking it down and it tastes great   but will add it to my smoothies and juiced fruit juices next  This product is so economical compared to purchasing fresh blueberries  especially because there is no waste due to mold or overripe berries thrown away  I think you could add this to baked or unbaked foods as well  Im excited to add more of the SuperFoods to my diet in this fast and easy way  I definitely will being trying the other flavors soon  The pork chops from Omaha Steaks were very tasty but at the same time exceptionally dry  Pork is usually dry meat but these were to the extreme  Possibly shipping them frozen and keeping them frozen was partly the problem  Five minutes in  one tentacle was bitten off  ball inside cracked in half  Not durable enough to be a dog toy  Disappointed   So is the dog   I am chemical sensitive as well as sugarfree  I have been using this product for over a year  I use it maybe once a week at the most  I drink 12 the bottle and then boost my energy after an hour or two depending on how I feel  IMO this doesnt replace my a  m  coffee but is sweet in the early afternoon when I start to fade  Once in a while I drink a full bottle before a workout  Ive been drinking Guayaki Yerba Mate teas for years  Compared to the many toxic energy boosters out there I highly recommend this  This product is clean and doesnt leave nasty chems behind in the body  Try it before you judge from a review  everyones body reacts differently  I felt energized within five minutes  but it lasted for about 45 minutes  I paid  399 for this drink  I could have just drunk a cup of coffee and saved my money  Yes  its probably healthier than 5  Hour Energy or Starbucks shots but if youre looking to avoid a caffeine overload  this is still not for you  Most energy drinks cannot be made w  out a high dosage of caffeine  I believe the caffeine content of 1 Guayaki shot is 150 mL  probably lower than other unhealthy energy shot drinks but I believe most other people avoid the top brands b  c they contain too much caffeine and  or sugar  If you do not react well to caffeine  Guayaki is not a good buy either  I definitely feel an energy boost w  1 full Guayaki shot but not w  out all the other caffeine side effects  irritability  nervousness  moodswings  Caffeine overdose is why I stopped drinking coffee  But it looks even organic energy drinks are still not safe   br    br   Now youre NOT sensitive to caffeine  then its a great buy  Its not loaded w  sugar  The taste is easy and pleasant  Its not loaded w  a bunch of chemicals like 5  Hour shots or Starbucks drinks  And the energy boost lasts for about 4 to 5 hours  Takes about 5 to 7 minutes to kick in but all this probably depends on your body  weight   br    br   Side note  if you want to feel energized during the day  have a protein drink first thing in the morning and stay away for heavy  fattening foods during the day that will make you feel sluggish and sleepy  These Nature Valley Nut Lovers Variety Pack was perfect  Although I wasnt sure about the peanut butter bar  it was excellent  I loved the Roasted Almond  Roasted Pecan and the Peanut Butter   br    br   I will definately buy from this seller again  Quick shipping and very fresh  I so wish I would have read this review before purchasing TWO gallons of this oil for my health issues  It reeks like a chemical rubber smell  This smell is coming from the black rubber gasket in the lid  When I called to report the situation to the company  Sabrina told me I would have to pay to send them a sample to have tested by a lab  Unbelievable  Good customer service would indicate that they would pay for the product to be returned and give me a full refund  including shipping  The product is faulty  Period  I will never order anything from this company again and do not recommend it to anyone based on this horrible customer service and lack of responsibility and ownership  This product has a strong aftertaste of Crayola crayons   br    br   I am in the process of trying different brands of coconut oils for cooking purposes  Upon opening the plastic container  the aroma of crayons immediately fills the room  and this flavor permeates the food that is cooked in it   br    br   I suspect the source of the problem is the plastic used in the plastic container as I have not experienced this with any of the other brands purchased   br    br   To date  my favorite coconut oil is distributed by Barleans  The flavor is fantastic  However  they do not supply a gallonsized tub  and Dr  Mercola has the best product in that size category  Had this shipped to my sister who follows a glutenfree eating plan and she reports that it is very versatile and easier than grinding almonds for a crispy crust on chicken and fish filets  Also uses it in place of bread crumbs in meatloaf and meatballs  Stays moist when added in place of wheat flour in baking  too  Good product  good value  These are healthy and my mixed Llasa  Tibetan Terrier adores them  And they are healthy and his breath doesnt smell and his teeth are in good shape because of such products  A great healthy product  A great healthy chew for my 9 wk old beagle  Rio  He loves the taste and it sure beats my arm  I really enjoy this product  I had such a hard time finding it affordable in the store  Once I found it I look no further  its the only sugar I use  Thanks so much  I have used and liked Sugar in the Raw for many years  after being introduced to it in a Starbucks  My most recent purchase  however  was disappointing  The sugar was lighter in color and had a crystal size maybe 14 th of the regular size  Having large crystals was something I always really liked about Sugar in the Raw  It enhanced the quality of mixed drinks and of lattes  I called their hotline to complain and was told that they had had a problem with their recent sugar crop and that the result was less molasses in the sugar  They have had many complaints of a similar nature  This  they claimed  also reduced the crystal size  They said this problem should go away with their newer crop  The representative said that the newcrop sugar will have a 610 digit date code  without ANY spaces  that ends with a  1  and no letters  The trailing digits are a date code using the Julian calendar   My recent badpurchase had a space after the initial sequence of numbers and then ended with a  51A    Bottom line  their current product is not much better than much cheaper products  When they get a better crop  Ill go back to purchasing Sugar in the Raw   Sugar in the Raw   tm  Please Harvest Cane w  o Burning  br   To be delivered to  HC  S  br   Dear  Sugar in the Raw  folks   br    br   We who buy your product care about the environment  And wed like to know that you care too  When you burn the cane fields on Maui  it adds to the CO2 and worsens climate change  And the smoke from your burning is damaging the lungs of your workers  your workers  children and the residents of Maui   br    br   We love your product and want you to change to noburn harvesting so we can continue to buy it  knowing we arent contributing to Global Warming and lung disease   br    br      Love this sugar  I also get muscavado sugar and they are both great to use in place of regular white sugar  Recommend  Product is exactly as advertised  What a savings  At least half the retail price  Easy to store because of the individual packaging  I used to buy this sugar for years  I do not eat much sugar  but still  This sugar is called turbinado sugar  but is misleading  I picked this brand just because it says real turbinado sugar  and other brands  in the local food store  that their sugar is brown because it is colored with caramel or something   br    br   HOW did i find out  I needed just a sweet water few days ago  I put this Sugar in The Raw in the glass  The water became brown and on the bottom of the glass i got just PURE WHITE SUGAR CRYSTALS    What a shame on the producer  U can try to put this sugar in your mouth and after few seconds you will spit out pure white crystals as well   br    br   Im just wondering if the consumers can hold the company liable for such a practice  Its just sugar in the raw  its flavor profile is much better then white sugar and its suppose to be better for you or something  I just wish the bags were resealable  This is a delicious sugar  It has a pretty light brown color and delicious aroma  But the granules are quite big  however   bigger than plain refined sugar  This makes is difficult to cream butter and sugar together  But if you use it in a recipe where you will melt the sugar first before baking it  or if you use it to brew beer and plan to boil it to melt it  it is a great product  It would be the perfect sugar if only the granules were a bit finer  I only use raw sugar  it did seem a little smaller than the normal crystals but it is still good  Will buy again  This sugar is very good  Use this in your coffee  cereal  etc for a week and youll never go back to white sugar  white sugar will taste terrible  Plus from what Ive read  this Raw sugar contains a lot of minerals that are missing in our diets   br    br   The product was delivered fast and wellpackaged  My only complaint is the price  I wish I could find Raw sugar cheaper  I would be happy to buy in bulk  but this is the cheapest I have found  I thought this was a great buy  but as noted by Scott D   the molasses content was not up to par  I loved the higher molasses content  Sugar in the Raw   Unfortunately what I purchased recently does not have the higher molasses content and I have twelve 24 ounce bags  I guess Ill watch for the next crop  I really love this sugar and pricewise its much cheaper to buy it here on amazon compared to anywhere else  Love this sugar  It tastes so much better and isnt as overly sweet tasting as  regular  sugar  Weve used it in quite a few baking items and they always turn out very good  The price that Amazon has this set at is very good to and makes it easy to use this for everyday stuff  Cant say anything bad about Sugar in the Raw  I like it better than the other  natural  sugars  Better consistency and  I know it doesnt matter  but better color  Unfortunately  one of the  natural  paper bags got torn a bit in the box  It didnt look like the box was damaged so I cant tell how it happened  but it was sort of pain to clean up half a bag that spilled all over the inside of the box and our kitchen when I opened it  Not sure what the solution is and Id order it again  but if it happens again  Id switch to one of the brands that ship in an unnatural plastic bag  Great service  Items arrived faster than expected  Very efficient  Will use this seller again  I highly recommend this seller  Thank you for the excellent service  Please ignore the onestar comments  if you check the bag the main ingredient IS in fact whole grain brown rice and the second is rice flower  With anything that is gluten free you have to add another  binder  which is where the corn flour comes in  For someone who has celiac disease and cannot have Sunchips  because they contain wheat  a key binder to any chip  cookie or cereal  this is an excellent product  My spouse and I buy these a lot because they are gluten free and absolutely delicious  Best flavor ever  Im addicted  They are all good but these are by far the best  I could live on these  And there is no need for anymore to say  So many  healthy  products dont taste very good  Or taste good when you first try them and then go downhill  Ive had these chips on more than one occasion and they are very tasty  Ive served them to guests twice and both times they wanted to know what they were and where to get them  Its also nice to have something glutenfree for friends who are borderline diabetic  but I would eat them anyway  I found these crisps at our local WalMart  figured I would give them a try  They were so yummy I may never go back to regular chips  not that I was a big chip fan anyway  The only problem is I can eat the entire bag in one sitting  I give these crisps a big thumbs up  This is one of the best tasting crisps I have ever eaten  I only buy it on special occassions because I know Ill eat the whole bag  I paid  179 for a 2 ounce pkg of these at lunch today  I bought them because brown rice is a  good  carb  As soon as I tasted one and it tasted like a corn chip I checked the ingredients  The name is deceptive  these have  Masa corn flour  listed in the ingredients and it overwhelms the taste  I wont buy these again  I can get Sunchips for less money and similar taste  I use the Rotel Mild and I LOVE this product so muchit saves me on a daily basis  If youre trying to cook lower fat  healthier foods and in a HURRY  this stuff makes it so much easier  Ever notice that some canned tomatos have a weird  tin can  taste when you make spagehetti sauce or whatever  For some reason this product doesnt have that  It tastes so good you can just dump it in with a can of beans  heat and eat   br    br   or add some chili powder and now you have chili soup  I also make indian dishes with this  and spicey spaghetti sauce  I also prefer this to most canned salsas  so it works for things like quesadillas if you drain the liquid off   br    br   None of my local grocery stores carry it at all  nor do they carry anything like it  So I have to pay Amazons inflated price to order this by the case  I dont like that Im paying a higher price  but I LOVE LOVE LOVE the product  the price on this product certainly raises my attention on compairing amazon price with the local stores  i can get a can of this rotel at my local kroger for  1  dissapointing  howdy yall   br    br   the actual product is VERY good  id rate the item a 4 on its own  however  its only ONE dollar at the local grocery and   twenty eight  dollars per twelve pack  these are running almost two and a half dollars each   br    br   as i said  TOO EXPENSIVE    sigh    i was really hoping to get them at something approaching the local cost   br    br   take care   br   lee Nothing wrong with the product  but I sure had to mix it with  lots  of other ingredients to make it edible to me   In Texas I was called a  babymouth   not into very spicyhot foods    br    br   For comparison  Im comfortable with Tostitos medium chunky salsa  1 can of this milder Rotel  mixed with 2 slightly larger cans of diced tomatoes  was still way too hot for me to use as salsa for chips  I used some of this to make a sort of southwestern cornbread that was good though  This is a fantastic product  and I wish it was readily available in most stores  Its taste is not the greatest  but its a 25 oz  shot  and its gone in a second  It tastes  more or less  like a concentrated sweet tea  For the record  Ive had 5 hour energy  and that tastes FAR worse  I will put up the taste for the results  Its got 150mg of caffeine  which is the equivalent of the big red bulls and monsters  I cant stand sucralose and sugar substitutes  and this is one of the only shot sized energy drinks that has only sugar in it  The sugar is at 9g  which isnt horrible  I used to drink 4 16oz  Red Bulls a day for the caffeine  and this gives me far better energy  and is much more subtle  My preference is black coffee  but I cant drink 812 cups a day anymore  Overall  Steaz does it right  real organic ingredients in moderate amounts  and they create big results  I have to get up really early to work out before work and I get super tired by the middle of the afternoon  I was drinking one 5 hour energy  usually extra strength  each day  It worked well  but gave me a jittery feeling  almost headachy but not quite  My husband got me to try this and I was skeptical  but for me it works as well if not better than the 5 hour energy and doesnt give me that jittery almostheadache feeling   br    br   I dont mind the tasteit reminds me of the inside of a fig newton  mmm   And the price is ok  on Amazon anyway  At my grocery store they were almost  3 each  yike   br    br   And its organicso I can feel good about it  right  Its all about me feeling good  I bought these for my husband and he said they are the best energy shots out there  He takes one in the mornings and works hard all day  Good stuff  I am a energy junkie and Im not sure if this works or not  but what I do know is that the taste is not the greatest  I do drink the steaz energy drink and I think I get the same results  I like this products because it is more natural then the others  If you want an organic energy shot  your choices are this one from Steaz and the assorted flavors from Guayaki  Guayaki Yerba Mate is actually in the Steaz energy shot and energy drinks  and they both use Sambazon Acai  so there are some similarities in ingredients   br    br   Great energy burst for 4  hours on a Steaz Energy Shot  and no withdrawals or headaches afterwards  Plan on drinking one every day at lunch at work  This will help me cut down on my iced coffees  which are not helping my calorie intake   br    br   Already ordering 12  packs on subscribe and save  2 per month  Great value  I was looking for a natural energy shot that works  and I found it  Steaz energy shot is my favorite   br    br   I recently had gastric bypass surgery  so tons of sugar is a nono  And Im also allergic to Sucralose  Splenda  so most other energy drinks are out   br    br   I tried Bazi energy shots and they didnt work as well as Steaz  and definitely didnt taste as well  These have a taste thats almost like CocaColanot bad at all   br    br   If youre looking for natural energy  give these a try  I had tried both of the Guayaki energy shots and I dont like the taste of either of them  This one has more natural caffeine and tastes much better  I like them cold for sure  My husband and I take these on road trips in a little cooler with ice and waters and we dont have to make stops for coffee  Especially on the turnpikes where its just way too expensive  Its worth the     per shot  We normally split them  Im really sensitive to caffeine  even the natural kind so I get a little weird if I drink the whole thing but thats the same for coffee too for me  My husband drinks the whole shot and gets a nice wake up boost  I would recommend these over any of the sinthetic shots out there  You can feel good about putting this in your body  Ill be ordering again soon for sure  I purchased it because it was on sale  In terms of the energy it provides  it works  but the taste leaves something to be desired  I tried mixing it with some water to make it more drinkable  Ive been feeling extremely tired around the late afternoon  As a software engineer  this is entirely unacceptable  So  I asked the nice lady at the counter of my local Whole Foods Market  for something that will give me that extra energy I need to get through the day   br    br   She excitedly returned with a suspicious little green bottle  Over three hours after drinking whatever that was  my brain is still working at unnatural speeds  To summarize my experiences  I believe this works   br    br   She did explain that I needed to drink plenty of water with it  which I personally feel helped the energy level  So if youre feeling tired during the day and hate coffee  give this a shot  preferably before you eat anything   br    br   Woot  The energy shot truly does work  It had a terrible aftertaste at first  but now that I know what to expect  I am getting used to it  I always have some water handy as a chaser  which helps  I am so glad to have found something that gives me the energy I need without all the chemicals found in other beverages  Its helped me kick my addiction to Diet Coke and other aspartamelaced caffeinated beverages  Yay    Ive tried 5  hour energy  red rain  NOS  and other energy shots  This is my favorite in terms of taste and effect  Plus  its somewhat reassuring to know that natural ingredients are used  Sometimes I wonder what Im really putting into my body with some of the other brands  I purchase a box about once every 2 months for the past 2 years  If youre looking for an energy boost without artificial sweeteners and other chemicals  this is a great option  The taste is decent and it is a nice smooth uplift without jitters  I first found Steaz Berry Energy Shots at a local organic market  I bought two bottles  which cost just under three dollars each  I fell in love instantly  The drink is delicious   I can taste the yerba mate and the acai juice  like a slightly bitter fruity chocolate honey tea  I am very sensitive to sucralose  Splenda  which is in so many energy drinks these days  I also hate the taste  I love that Steaz has actual sugar and no artificial sweeteners  The rush it gives me is slow and even  I have several medical conditions  including fibromyalgia  which saps me of energy and causes intense pain  I like how Steaz helps clear away the fatigue and fog so I can get things done  No caffeine jitters  even though there are 150 mg of caffeine in each bottle   br   It was becoming expensive for me to buy the bottles separately at stores  so I started looking online for a bulk price  I am so thrilled to have found the Pack Of 12 on Amazon  I signed up for Amazon Prime specifically for this product  hah  I have tried other energy shots and this one is the only one that really makes me feel good and energized without any other sides effects at all  its also the best taste  others taste like medicine  this one has a tea fresh taste  I love it  I drive OTR  Over the Road truck and this helps to keep me alert  It has no sugar high  no crash  Im on a autoship which i like  The price is very good  Ive seen it over 2 bucks in the store  Products takes pretty good  and it doesnt leave you gittery  With subscibe and save as well as Prime membership I pay below  2 a shot  My wife tried them and now she drinks them like they are going out of style  I moderate mine and they make for more effective use before weight training  I recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a healthier alternative to high sugar and unnatural products that are everywhere that still gives you the results of an AWESOME Energy Drink  I use this product daily  and it provides a steady stream of energy  I do not get jittery or crash  It also helps me practice portion control because it acts as a slight appetite suppressant  Ive been buying and drinking this for over a year now  and the energy boost is excellent  with a continuous   6  hour effect  The most recent shipments seem to have improved the flavor slightly as well  or perhaps Im getting more used to it  I dont drink it for the flavor  but its not as heinous as the fake flavors found in the other  nonorganic energy shots  This is the first time Ive really been misled by other reviews on amazon  I like 5  hr Energy  I find Rain ok and so I thought Id try this product based on the reviews  Boy am I sorry  I gagged getting one bottle down even with my nose pinched  really   And it leaves the worst medicinal taste in your mouth afterwards  8 tic tacs at once did not get rid of it  But worst of all  within an hour I was yawning and drowsy  Unless you really like things that taste of a weird teaflavored cough syrup and dont work  dont buy this  I dont know what to do with the other 11 bottles  big fail I loved this mold  I wished I could have used it for more than one occasion  but it didnt last  I did use it to make 30  suckers for my daughters first birthday  But there was going to be no way that the mold could be salvaged after that  I would have liked to have kept to use on other occasions  but for the price it didnt matter to me that much  It served its main purpose  You HAVE to try the VANILLA Tootsie Rolls  The regular chocolate ones are good  but THESE are the BEST EVER   Try this you might like it  I did and I am quite addicted  it is too easy to prepare  it tastes great and it absorbs the flavors you cook it with  The price is really good and well worth the purchase  If you like this type of Couscous like I do  then give this one a tryIt can be eaten hot  room temp or in a cold salad with a variety of greens and other flavors  it takes on the other flavors very well when mixed  I cooked the Couscous with a broth and oilive oil for added flavor and it rocked my taste buds big time  I will be back for more  This tricolor couscous is really good  full of flavor and fun to eat  I love the texture  I cook in chicken broth and add some minced garlic and chopped herbs  parsley  cilantro   along with some red pepper flakes  At the end of cooking  I add some olive oil and this makes a wonderful side dish  Highly recommend I tried to find israeli couscous in a number of upsacale grocery stores and no luck  So I decided to try good ole Amazoncom and selected this product  It is so good  add a few herbs and its a great side dish  or add more and make a  pasta type  saladso very good  I am hooked  Great flavor and so easy to prepare  The package came with the label torn off and no cooking instructions  I know how I normally cook Couscous so tried 34 cup water to 1 cup couscousbrought to a boil and let sit  covered for 5min  It was mushy and tastelessWe have thrown out the rest of the container  I wouldnt even think of buying this product unless I know the price per unit  How can I compare other items online or in a store  I love ordering whole bean coffee on Amazon  I like this so much that this my first product review  I have to say that Im usually not a big fan of flavored coffee  but I thought I would give it a try  When my husband started grinding it up  I could smell it throughout the house  Sometimes with flavored coffees  the smell is there but the taste isnt  However  not with this one  Im now going to order another flavor from this company and will give it a try  I love this coffee  I do wish it came already ground as I dont have a grinder and use a blender instead  But its worth it  Many flavored coffees Ive tried only seem to have a flavored odor that doesnt reach the coffee  but this one manages both  This brand of coffee has been available in my local stores for some time   Ive believe the company is local  Ive been drinking it for quite some time and have not tired of it  Im particularly fond of the Turtle Sundae but all the flavors are good  I cant say that Ive had a bad one   br    br   As it turns out  its less expensive to order it from Amazon and have it show up at my front door than it is for me to run out to the local Walmart to get it  Its a no brainer  Try it  if you like rich  flavored coffee  youll like it  It is hot  I love it  tasty and a little sweet  I usually scoff at salsas labeled as hot  but this one lives up to its billing  I consume about a jar every two weeks of this  either adding it to fajitas or using it as a corn chip dip  It is hot  but after awhile the medium Salsa Suprema was too mild for me  I thought maybe Id cut down how much I ate by going to the hot Salsa Ranchera  Its hot enough that people who arent used to it will say  Thats hot     br    br   Flavor  bright and forward  The similarly hot Salsa Victoria is a duller taste to me  I guess earthy  This salsa is much brighter in the mouth  I dont like to go hotter than this because the sauces Ive tried lose any resemblance to yummy salsa and just taste hot  this happens to me with Tabasco sauce  for example    br    br   A drawback is La Victoria doesnt make a larger bottle of Salsa Ranchera nor Salsa Victoria  nor do they sell them in    or Sams Club  To get a good deal you have to watch for sales  service was great  but I meant to buy Swiss Chalet chicken SAUCE not the Marinade   br    br   Love the sauce  have yet to try the marinade Use frequently as we like to do Asian dishes at least once a week  Love this product  Fast shipping  as usual  Would buy again  These individually wrapped pieces are delicious  although I wish there were a few more   Mildly sweet with no sugarfree aftertaste  even a traditional  marzipanaholic  should enjoy these  Put this in my husbands stocking for Christmas and it was a hit  I was amazed at how quickly it arrived  It is a cute stocking stuffer  but only OK as far as user appeal  You get what you pay for  Toy was typical quality I expected  I got taken for a major ride on the shipping  So we cancelled the order  It was cancelled without any problem  That is a positive note  i love the convenience of the singles  The best creamer aroundTaste is just like the big bottle  I can stick them in my purse and take them to work  These creamers come in 4 packs of 25  I have taken one to work and opened one for home so far  and havent found a single broken or leaking creamer yet  I usually have way too much cream and sugar in my coffee  but with these it is easy for me to cut down on the sweetness because I wont allow myself more than 2 creamers per cup  I think this is definitely the best option for buying creamers from Amazon since all the other listings have a lot of complaints about creamers breaking in shipping  Even though we are International Delight fans we were not completely dissapointed by this product  We had no problem with the shipment  but the creamer itself is thinner than International Delight  Other than that we are happy D Besides the obvious convenience and portability of the individual creamers  I liked this item specifically because of packaging  I couldnt believe how many reviews I read about coffee creamer cups  but many of the Amazon creamer options  both Coffeemate and International Delight  had multiple negative reviews due to the shipment arriving with broken cups thanks to sloppy packaging   br    br   That was not an issue here  The shipment arrived in four dispensing boxes of 50 each  as shown in the photo  those boxes were tightly packed in a thick cardboard box which could take a good beating before damaging the inner boxes  Thus  none of my cups were broken  no waste and no sloppy drippy mess  Plus the four boxes means I could put one in the kitchen  one in the bathroom  we moved our mini Keurig there when we upgraded the kitchen Keurig  best idea my husband ever had   and one at work  with a reserve for whichever runs out first   br    br   If you are looking for these mini creamers but deterred like I was by the negative packaging reviews on other options  this is your best bet  As a bonus  the auto delivery price is very reasonable  This seller is very nice  And the price is very good  The only reason I stop ording is bacause I went to sugar free  and at that time he did not have it  But for those of you that dont have to watch there fat in take  I would get this product from them  I purchased these coffee mate singles to use at work along with the coffee  tea  bags  Theyre great because they dont require refrigeration  I received the items in a timely manner  Upon receipt  I removed a pack to consume  The poptart was STALE and left an awful taste in my mouth  I found these new spring PopTarts and bought them on a whim  My kids and I were amazed and delighted at the fun  colorful  amazingly detailed artwork on these PopTarts  Fantastic for after school snacks  lunch boxes  and school treats  Tie with a ribbon for a bright  thinking of you this spring  gift  The only challenge is finding more in stores  Way to go Kelloggs  fantastic product  Yes  I am having a cup right now  I went all over town looking for this coffee after been invited to a non profit organization to a banquet and besides the delicious food they top it off with this amazing delicious coffee  I paid and extra 20 bucks to get it right way and it is worth the money  Highly recommend  Taste like it is stale  Will not order this again  I had this coffee at a 50th year annerversery at a reception hall and had to have it  This stuff tasted NOTHING  like the Douwe Egberts at the hall  This is possibly stale coffee  Serveice delivery with the seller was excellent  The product was not  Will not order again  Bad taste  Iam not sure if it was old or that how it tastes  I throw it right away  i coudl not drink it  This is honestly THE BEST seasoning salt in all the land  It tightens up any dish  not spicy  just perfectly seasoned  Its perfect  hence  my purchase of this 35 oz  mamma jamma  The order arrived as advertised  I have had only a few chances to use it  but it is awesome  The flavor is exactly what I hoped for  It may take me a while to finish the entire gallon  but I will definnantly order again  I like a lot of sesame oil and use it in salads regularly  Great quality  flavor and aroma  Cant beat that its organic  Bought a set of two when my son was about 6 months  and we started taking them with us whenever we went out to eat  I cut up cantaloupe  apple  banana  even used sweet potatoes a few times    just whatever I could get at the restaurant   and it would keep my son busy long enough that I could actually eat  Its great because I didnt have to be overly worried about him choking on big chunks  and he got to try out new foods  I wouldnt hesitate to buy this again  I have a slightly different version of this  different brand  My son started using it around six months  and he really enjoys it  He DOES get messy if he eats something sticky or juicy like banana or watermelon  but whatever  Anyway  I also had trouble cleaning it  until I tried scrubbing it with a nail or vegetable brush  That works pretty well  It takes some time  but not as much as it would take to run food through a food mill or blender  or cut it up  then clean it up off him  the chair  the floor  the dog  me  well you get the picture  What a GREAT idea    My daughter love it   br   I dont think is difficult to wash  I mean  is not like just toss water and thats it  but  come on     br   Absolutely recommend it  This product is impossible to wash and actually get cleaned  I couldnt get the food pieces out to save my life  I tried scrubbing them out and even washed it in the dishwasher as it suggests  I loved this product for fruits and other food that I didnt want my new baby to choke on  I also used it to put ice in when my baby was teething  It worked great for this  as well as for the food  I didnt like bananas in it thoughimpossible to get clean  I love  love  love the idea of this product and my little one loves  loves  loves to use it  She gets fresh fruit and other tasty things and I dont have to worry about her choking  The only drawback is that bits of food get stuck in the mesh and the seams and are impossible to get out  Granted  some foods are more difficult than others and some dont cause that much of a problem  Bananas however  have pretty much destroyed a couple of them  While I love this product  I think that next time I will get the one that has the removable and replaceable mesh bags  The Munchkin fresh food feeder is an okay product  its kind of like sucking on food through a cloth  While my daughter was interested in it for a little while  she eventually lost interest  I may introduce it back to her again and see how she reacts  This product is amazing  I know a few people with little ones that use these and they LOVE them   Super easy to clean and use  When ordering these  I was under the impression that there were 2 per package  FYItheyre not   Only one per  I ordered these for my coffee themed wedding  When they arrived I had to fight off friends because they smelled and tasted so good  I literally had to hide the box to the wedding  They were a big hit on my wedding day and there were none left over that we put on the tables  It was a great tasting product for the lowest price Ive seen   These are delicious  The chocolate is excellent and the espresso bean was the perfect roast for this purpose  Crunchy and not bitter    a href   httpwwwamazoncomgpproductB00067AD4U   Chocolate Covered Espresso Beans 5 Pounds a The product was exactly as advertised and fresh  Unfortunately  I keep them in a candy dish in the office and they are going fast  We need to reorder to keep up with  demand  These chocolate covered espresso beans are wonderful  The chocolate is very dark and rich and the  bean  inside is a very delightful blend of flavors with just enough caffine to really give it a zing  Popchips are so good  I have been following Weight Watchers and lost 50 pounds and am at my goal  These Popchips are my salty crunchy indulgence  They taste so good  Ive purchased dozens of bags of this pancake mix  which is a great product  by the way   This is the highest price Ive seen  Whole Foods carries this item and its been on sale there for  999  thats Canadian dollars  too  as Im in Canada   Its even cheaper on Bakers Boxs own website  and theyre the company selling this product through Amazon  For a twopack they should be charging  20 or less  What gives  I thought Amazon was where you could find competitive prices  The Sugar was sweet  that can not be denied  As advertised  It didnt melt when baked either  However  it will not do for your Liege Waffles  Gaufres what the larger pebbles of Belgian pearl will do  These grains are smaller  think pretzel salt  or seed pearls  Thats exactly what I was looking for to bake some chouquettes  puffs with small sugar pearls on top   Works great  yum   This is what I was looking for and was missing it  The taste is exactly the taste as the one made in India so just loved it and remember my days back in India  Definitely recommend it  I bought this strawberry extract hoping to spruce up a strawberry wine that ended up with less flavor than Id original expected   A common problem in some fruit wines    br    br   This is  indeed  good strawberry flavor  Just add to your sugary concoction  be it a baking good  a dessert or a drink  to either give strawberry flavor  or add to existing flavor   and presto  just about everyone will be licking their lips  and maybe fingers    br    br   For those interested  I found the right addition to a liquid volume to be 4 oz of extract per 1 gallon of liquid  Great stuff and dependable  especially when there are a million brands  out there  to choose from  I love the stuff  For really high end desires  I go with the Apollo Olive Oils from California  But I buy a whole lot more of this stuff and will buy it again and again  I hadnt tried  or heard of  till recently Weavers not its my favorite  I am running through the list of types they have looking for a favorite and havent found one yet  theyre all so darned smooth  No bite  no after taste  a little pricy but still worth it  No worse price wise than starbucks or peets  Will keep running through the list here and see what happens  Love them all so far  Having always been a strict Peets Coffee lover  I was reticent to switch brands but Weavers won my heart   The taste is clean and strong  the ethos is correct  organic  baby  and even the packaging is very zen and appropriate  Be still my caffeinated heart  Go ahead and drink the other brands served at your neighborhood cafe if you must but make sure you have a stash of Weavers Peru Organic Whole Bean at home to serve up to your friends and family who deserve the best coffee  And when you go back to that corner cafe where people drink average coffee because they dont know better  take along a travel mug filled with Weavers coffee from home and enjoy a real Cup of Joe  Er  Weavers  A very bitter tasting coffee even when enhanced with cream and  or honey  Definately not my cup of coffee  Oh  did i say it was bitter  Im learning that Latin American and South American coffees have this distinct  coffee  caramelish finish  As a Peets Coffee fanatics we learned that Weavers roaster was the roaster for Peets and we are hooked  I already reviewd the French and Organic blend  but I must say this coffee here is a perfect afternoon drink   br   Met the weavers team at the Warner Brothers party and they gave me a half a pound of french roast  Since them we are fans   br   You wont be dissapointed  I like eating these whenever I need an energy boost   br   It has everything that I am searching for in a   To Go Snack    br   Fiber plus Chocolate is never a bad thing    These are my favorite bars ever  The combo of raisons and dark choc is wonderful  Very filling  These are hard to find in the stores  Im thankful for subsrcibe and save  My fiance loves these dark chocolate and nut granola bars and all the grocery stores around us dont carry them anymore  Once again  Amazon came through and he couldnt be happier  I was buying Quaker Oats granola bars but these Nature Valley chewy bars are better tasting  they make a great snack when Im on the go  Chocolate  peanuts and raisins  it doesnt get any better  Hard to get husband to eat breakfast before school  He takes two bars now and is very happy to do so  It is often hard to find flavor in local grocery stores  So again  Amazoncom came through with a reasonable price  Now  I came keep the husbands breakfast ready as he runs out the door in the mornings  I often like to have a bar in the evening as a night snack   Nantucket Blend coffee is one of my favorites  I was suprised that it was a single box  every time I ordered before it was a 2 pack  My fault for not reading closer  I will not order any more at this price for 1  24 count  Green Mountain  Nantucket Blend  KCups make a very

pack of pods to try out different blends and flavors  Of the 12 pods we had in the box  four were Green Mountain Coffee brand  Id never tried anything from this company before  but from what I had researched online  they have the largest range of Keurig pods and have even bought out competitors to produce coffee under their brand names as well   br    br   Unfortunately  I was immediately disappointed by the quality of the coffee  We tried their Dark Magic  Decaf and Breakfast Blend and all were underwhelming  to say the least  I was almost completely set on writing off Green Mountain altogther   br    br   We had one GM pod left and being of the mindset of wastenotwantnot  I figured Id give it one last go around before forgetting about them completely  And Im glad I did   br    br   The Nantucket Blend is a perfectly pleasing cup of coffee  It is nice and flavorful without being thick and pungent  unlike some of the other GM blends we tried   I added some flavored creamer to it and it almost measures up to our goto Caribou Blend pods  Almost  All in all  this is a very standard cup of coffee which  while it isnt anything new or exciting  is very pleasing and definitely one of the better Keurig options weve been able to test out  When we run out of all the pods weve accumulated  Ill probably pick up a box of these as well   br    br   Now that I know Green Mountain isnt completely disappointing Ill definitely be open to trying a few more of their coffees  with our promotion for getting the bewer we ordered  a href   httpwwwamazoncomgpproductB004I3Y4IE   Green Mountain Coffee Golden French Toast  KCup Portion Pack for Keurig KCup Brewers  24  Count a to try as well  and see how it goes from there   br    br   If youre looking for a goto choice  this is your cup  Green Mountain is my favorite brand  Nantucket is my favorite coffee from Green Mountain  Very smooth flavor  Not too strong and not too weak  I was looking for a replacement for Timothys Kona Blend which is no longer carried on Amazon  This coffee from Green Mountain is very nice  but not strong enough for me  If you like milder coffees  then this one is for you  One of Green Mountains best blends of coffee in my opinion  love it for your everyday blend  perfect stregnth  excellent blend  This is just Fantastic Chicken Noodle soup  the best I have ever eaten  with large hearty chunks of chicken  and vegetables and nice large noodles  This soup is just so full bodied  and is seasoned just right  I am so glad Amazon carries this product  I just cant find it here in Vermont  I have used this oil for several years and it is the best for eating with bread or cooking  I love the regular  I use it on everything  You wont be sorry you tired it  great for dipping bread and cooking omelet  and green beans  Oh my gosh  is this good  Like most people  Ive been eating ketchup my whole life and never really thought anything about it  Then Hubby brought a jar of this home  The tomato flavor is amazing  I will never buy store ketchup every again  Sir Kensingtons did a great job of updating the classic ketchup with this wonderful product  The refreshed taste of this Ketchup is a great update  and now leaves me disappointed when Im given Heinz while out at a restaurant   br    br   For you Heinz die hard fans out there  this is not the ketchup for you  But for those of you who wish you always knew what ketchup could be without the chemical aftertaste found in Heinz  be sure to give this Ketchup a try   br    br   Dont forget the spiced variety  Purchasing the pack with both the classic and spiced variety for your first Sir Kensington experience is definitely the way to go  This is ridiculous  The best gourmet ketchup I have ever tasted  It is pricey  but wow  love this stuff  It would make a great gift for someone who is hard to buy for but loves their ketchup  Yummy  The tomatoes are the star of the classic flavor  It is clean and really fresh  Perfect on an avocado chicken sandwich   br    br   The spicy flavor is more complex and is the best ketchup I have ever tried  It is so good I have now used it on foods that would make me seem crazy  The spicy version of this ketchup isnt bad  but it is too expensive  The regular version is sweet as dessert  Horrible  Annies Organic has a much better flavor and costs a lot less  Even Heinz organic is a better deal  I gave it three stars instead of two because it is in glass  not plastic  These condiments are overpriced and terrible  The classic is disgustingly sweet  The spiced tastes like a bad spicy marinara sauce from a chain restaurant  I have been using porcini mushrooms in my cooking for twenty plus years  The Roland extra fancy porcinis that I purchased from you are the best that I have ever used  including the mushrooms that I bought in Italy and transported back to the USA  I was pretty pleased with these mushrooms  They were mostly large pieces  rehydrated well and had good flavor  Id estimate about 25  of the contents were broken into medium to small pieces  most likely due to the shaking about in transit  Not a problem since I sometimes break the large pieces into smaller ones for some recipes  There was a small amount  perhaps an ounce or so  of very small  mincedsize  dustlike pieces  Still useful to add into gravies and the like  Nothing gets wasted   br    br   The label says it is a product of China and Italy  Nothing was specified as to the proportion from each country   br    br   Im quite fond of dried mushrooms  While they may lack the texture you can get only when using fresh ones  the convenience of always having them on hand is a big plus  Additionally  I find the broth used to rehydrate them adds a wonderful flavor to soups and stews  To save time and add flavor  I sometimes add the dried mushrooms directly into the soup or stew without rehydrating them  Really helps meld all the flavors together  I also am fond of adding some to the cooking water when boiling pasta  The pasta picks up a wonderful earthy flavor when it cooks in the mushroominfused water   br    br   This was the first time I used the Roland brand  got it on a price dip from the Amazon Warehouse   and would certainly buy them again  Highly recommend  If you are a peanut lover  these are for you  Much larger than cocktail peanuts  Six people on my Christmas gift list ask for these every year   The cashews were nice and big  with the vast majority being whole  There were a number of small pieces at the bottom of the bag  but thats pretty expected with so many cashews  They made an absolutely excellent cashew brittle   br    br   My order took just over a week to arrive  which was pretty decent considering it was shipped across the country  They came double bagged in clear plastic bags  and in two 5 lb portions  This was highly convenient since I could just throw one of the bags into the freezer until I was ready to work with it   br    br   Great value for the price  Although there were several  shriveled  ones  they taste just fine  I mostly use them to make vegan sauces and other recipes that call for running them through a food processor so they dont have to look perfect anyways  For the price  they are a great deal  about half of what I find them for in the store  I ordered these after a fair bit of searching online  even ordering the smaller 13 oz bags  I will admit  I was a bit sceptical when I ordered this since it was not cheap and had no idea how good  or bad  the cashews would be   br    br   The order came in pretty fast  like 3 days  The cashews were fresh and whole  with like 10 broken pieces  They were in 2 5lb bags sealed with clear tape  first I found it odd but then it turned out to be a good deal  considering the second pack stayed fresh till I opened them  The trick is to actually keep them in an airtight box so that they stay fresh longer   br    br   The only negative I can think of is that the price went up abt  500 for the 10lb since I bought them  These nuts arrived fresh and are very tasty  They are not broken or dirty looking like cashews sometimes can  I bought these for my boyfriend who really likes honey roasted pecans in salads that I have at a couple of restaurants  Plus  he likes nuts  pecans  almonds peanuts  He loved these  I actually ordered 3 cans instead of the gift tin  so he could take one to work  or his place  and stay fresh longer  Although I dont think freshness will be an issue  they wont last long  lol My cat will go for a day  probably longer  havent tryed it  but hell walk right by this stuff every time  even when I know hes hungery  ABSOLUTELY NO INTEREST  I swear hed rather die of starvation then even take a wiff of it   Got this free with another order I placed  I couldnt believe how much the cats loved it  I will buy again for sure  This is a great ham soup base  I have used it in Ham and beans and seasoned greenbeans  Great flavor I havent used the ham base  It is loaded with MSG  I did not realize this when I ordered it and can not return it because it is a food item Before I discover this mix on Amazon I always bought it in Whole Food Store   br   I like this mix and when I am doing the pancakes they came very delicious and fluffy   br   Just one small secret  Try to add the Seltzer water instead of regular one  I appreciate the fact that I can buy this product online and have free shipping  This is a great all around mix that is very good with a wonderful texture  Thanks again amazon  Arrowhead Mills Buttermilk Pancake mix is my favorite mix  It tastes great  cooks up light and fluffy and is super easy to make  Although it can be made using water  I think its better made with milk  I love it with pure organic maple syrup  The pancakes taste great without any recipe adjustments for my sons egg allergy  Its also great for camping or any time youd like to be able to make pancakes without having fresh eggs available  HEY  These are GREAT Waffles and Pancakes  We have to add 50  more mix  tho  as the recipies on the bag are VERY thin  But we have a lot of fun with this Arrowhead Mills Buttermilk Pancake  Waffle

They taste fine for our family  we like them many ways  I love the flour however Amazon sent it with a book which broke a bag and made a mess  Customer sevice took care of the problem however it was a foolish way to ship the product  This mix is very poorly packaged and breaks open easily during shipping  Nearly a full bag of my order was spilled in the shipping box  3 bags out of 4 had come unsealed at the top  There were no tears in the packages  Just awful  I thought food was supposed to taste good  I had to eat ice cream afterwards to get the taste out of my mouth  its that bad  Perhaps the worst bottle of wine Ive ever had  Im not even sure I would cook with this  It is thin  no body  and a transparent color not characteristic of a good pinot  The taste is just bitter  not the complexity that I expect from a pinot noir of any price  Just not what Im looking for even in a low to mid price pinot noir  Maybe my bottle wasnt sealed well and went to vinegar  other reviews for this wine are favorable  A good tasting light chip that has some value in nutrition  Everyone get the munchies  is this is a good alternative to eating potato chips  This is a wonderful warm flavored tea  especially now in colder weather   br   This tea has a sweet  soothing chamomile fragrance  It is subtle and sweetIt  s one of the better chamomile teas   br   If you find it hard to sleep at times  a cup of this sweet chamomile tea may help   br   If you really like sweet taste try Bigelow Chamomile Mango Herbal Tea   br   I highly recommend both  This is one of the best mint chocolate syrup Ive ever had so far  The others pale in flavor by comparison  There are only seven ingredients in this sauce  including organic natural mint flavor  In the past I used ice cream heavy with other flavors like butterscotch  chocolate chips  Oreo cookies  caramel et al  because the mint flavor of other mint chocolate sauces was too pale  Now I buy plain vanilla or chocolate ice cream and the minty flavor of the Santa Cruz Organic Mint Chocolate syrup really stands out but doesnt overpower the flavor of the ice cream  There are only 110 calories  And because the mint flavor is very apparent to my taste  I use it sparingly  so this 155 oz container last a bit longer than the other syrups I used  This is a simple product and it is simply good  There are no extra ingredients that are hard to pronounce and have you scouring the internet finding out what they are  It is a bit thinner consistency than the usual syrup  so use caution the first time you go to squeeze some out  This will be great for people who like mint  it has a much stronger mint flavor than chocolate  I use it in my coffee with a bit of half and half  tastes great  Sometimes simple is better  A grande item  Delicious fish with the ultimate flavor  best ever in a can for all purposes  I sent a case to my Mother recently diagnosed with Diabetes  and she loves it as a main entree for cooking patties  I ordered this product at the same time as the Kirkland Signature salmon  The Raincoast Trading Co  salmon is very tasty  equally as good quality salmon as the Kirkland  However  the Raincoast arrived in perfect condition  the Kirkland cans were dented badly  I recommend this product to anyone who likes boneless skinless canned salmon  This tea tastes almost as good as the tea you would get at an Indian restaurant  Its much better than getting a teabag and making it the English way  with a lot of water and a bit of milk  This is very creamy and tasty  My only criticism is that there arent enough sachets in the box  Only 10  Since the directions say that you use one sachet for 100ml of water  approximately half a cup   its not enough for a good cup of tea  so I use two  That means that one box is only good enough for five cups of tea  But its a delicious afterdinner drink  I would buy this again if there were more sachets in a box  i love this product cant find it locally  Sometimes little out of the way stores have itBut i also love the chicken  pork chop bagsEvery store i go in i look for them the lastplace i found it was at a meat market  This is the best way to cook a roast  Our local grocery went out of buisness and so I could not find this product till I looked here  Please continue to keep this product available  Its always a pleasure to find Frenchs products on the web  All of the markets in my area have made a bargain to carry nothing but McCormacks bland and tasteless seasonings   br    br   This is the most flavorful cooking bag mix you will ever find  If you like Oreos or the Oreo cakester  then youve got to try the Double Stuff cakesters    These are the best   Side note  shipping was very slow  but maybe your chances will be better  I was surprised about how good this was my family and friends laughed when I told them I bought this  But out of the can ready mix with a little salt  pepper  spinach  and some cheese and its a great easy meal  The thing about Marmite is that those who dont like it hate it  and those who love it cant live without it  Its very much  an English thing  and the language has even adopted the trade name as a metaphor  as in  Victoria Beckham is Marmite  meaning that those who dont like her  etc    Amazon has done the world a favor by making this weird and wonderful stuff available at an affordable price  Last time I looked  it was  25 a 500g jar in British stores in LACounty  or about 4x what it costs in England  The Amazon supplier was quick and efficient  and I now have enough Marmite to last me to the end of the year  or would have  if I didnt decide to send one of the two jars to my son in Japan    Good job  Amazon  A vile  miserable pancake  I put these in front of my toddler one morning and she actually cried  I dont know if it was their flat and anemic appearance or their salty bitter taste  Only the whole wheat flour is organic in this mix  The buttermilk  baking soda  SLS  and sea salt are not  I am going back to Natures Path Buttermilk pancake mix  This one went straight into the garbage  Whats there to say about a fantastic chocolate chip cookie  The only thing that could be improved is if they offered a bushel box of these so you would not run out so fast  Hope these dont go the way of the dinosaur  These arrived on time and packaged in green plastic wrap  The cookies were as fresh as the boxes found in the local grocery store   br    br   I have no complaints but I also now have no more cookies  We ate them all  I was not expecting to like these cookies as much as I do  I like chocolate chip cookies well enough  but I really prefer a soft cookie to crisp ones  I have to say these Famous Amos cookies have pertty much turned me around  The cookies are rich and have that depth of flavor that comes from quality ingredients  The chips are real chocolate and melt redilly in your mouth creating a moist experience while chewing  These are truly great cookies  They arent fattening and theyre good for you  right  Thats what I heard  at least  from an admittedly unreliable person  Great if you are cutting back on fat  they do resemble regular chips but are nothing like them  Extremely dry and hard  I have never met a Kettle brand chip I did not like  These chips have a great loaded potato flavor  which are flavorful  I like the sweet onion chips better  but these are also at the top of the list for greattasting potato chips  Kettle chips are great chips f  the money  After buying bags one at a time  at a hefty markup  at nearby stores  I decided to try bulk ordering some snack foods on Amazon  I was very pleased with the price and the products   br    br   These jalapeno kettle chips are not overly spicy  they have a slowbuilding spice that starts very subtly a grows if you eat the whole bag  which Im embarrassed to say I did quite a few times   br    br   The chips arrived wellpacked and fresh  They had nearly a year of time before they expired  which is pretty impressive for chips   br    br   Most importantly  the priceperbag was much  MUCH better than any local store could do  although I live near an expensive city  so that may play a role in the price difference   br    br   I wouldnt hesitate to order another box of these once I run out  I buy mostly for vending  so the size of the bag is important  Kettles 1 oz bag is a good size although it seems a bit less than full  Salt  Vinegar flavor is satisfying  about an 8 out of 10  Glad to find these in a one ounce size but the bag seems a bit less than full  Its hard to find single serving chip bags that vend well  Sometimes they are too wide  or too plump with air  Bag size is good  BBQ flavor is about an 8 out of 10  one of the best chips that you can buy  and ive tried all the kettle varieties  and many others  Theres only a slight taste of jalapeno  and they are delicious  Perfect with a sandwich or alone   br   If you like being addicted  these are the chip for you   See you at addicts anonymous  The title says it all  Great flavor  hint of spice  excellent crunch  We eat Kettle chips by the truck load at my house  we like all the flavors but this one far and away is our favorite  never enough bags to get us to our next shipment  I just wish Amazon could get the larger bags on subscribe and save  If you buy these make sure you have enough for everyone otherwise you may not get enough for yourself    WOW  I have eaten quite a few potato chips in my day  Kettle chips are the BEST nonbaked chips I have eaten  I decided to try the sweet onion chips  since Ive never had them  I now have a FAVORITE   If you like onions  this is a MUST buy  I will definitely reorder these  as I mentioned above  they are the BEST I have ever eaten  The flavor is GREAT  I cannot say how much I love Kettle brand potato chips  Kettle brand has a large variety of unique flavors  and the quality of the chips themselves blows all other potato chips out of the water  The ingredients list is printed on each bag and the only thing really bad for it is the oil they are frying the chips in  I love that these arent filled with nasty chemicals  I ordered the cheddar and sour cream krinkle cut ones which are great but I was torn between the  a href   httpwwwamazoncomgpproductB0048IFUSC   Kettle Brand Potato Chips Fully Loaded Baked Potato  2  Ounce  Pack of 24  a and the Jalapeno flavor  While I know the jalapeno flavor is good but this is way better  They include liquid smoke instead of actual bacon which Im fine with since Ive a vegetarian  I ordered this to give to guests coming from out of town for my wedding this spring and I cant guarantee how many I will have left  My fiance and I love these  The packaging is perfect for anyone who is giving these to kids to take for school lunches  or handing out in gift bags  even just for portion control  Now  I havent done a sidebyside comparison  but these chips still taste like the real deal  These snack sized bags do as well as the regular brand at the grocery store I work for  Portion control AND reduced fat  Yes  please  With the Subscribe  Save these are much cheaper than at the grocery store  I love Kettle Brand Chips   br   Ive been in love with the Honey Dijon for years and decided to try out their other flavors   br    br   Sea Salt  Vinegar Chips are TANGY  SOUR  and make my lips pucker when I eat too many at a time  I got 12 big bags for a steal from amazon   11 WHAT       br    br   Personally  the flavor is too much for me  but my mom  aunt LOVE them and they hate potato chips  These chips are thick and crunchy  I absolutely love them  The taste is perfect  I like to buy these smaller bags because I cant trust myself with a large bag of these because they taste no good  I enjoy these chips  I got these instead of my usual jalapeno ones from the same company for a bit of flavor change  I think those are better but only slightly  like the jalapenos there is a great amount of flavor without being too overpowering  The small bag size prevents you from overeating as with a larger bag  I love these chips  I buy the 24 pack once a month  The bags are just the right size for snacking and prevent me from eating way too much with the larger bags  The jalapeno spice is subtle enough not to be overpowering but still gives you a great amount of flavor  These are the strongest tasting salt and vinegar chips Ive had  I could still do with more vinegar flavor  but I think this is as close as Im going to get without dousing them with vinegar powder myself   br    br   I did a side by side with the Cape Cod salt and vinegar and these are about twice as flavorful  Additionally  as other reviewers have said  they have quite a good bit of potassium in them  somewhere in the neighbor of 15  RDA per serving   I have been ordering the sea salt chips for about a year  I love them  but my daughter picked some of these up at our local grocery store and now they are my new favoriteWill be ordering them  These are my favorite glutenfree dairyfree flavored chips  Many other salt and vinegar chips contain dairy so its nice to find ones that I can eat  The vinegar flavor is really intense and good  These Kettle Brand potato chips in the Spicy Thai flavor really do taste like food I have eaten at a Thai restaurant  The ingredients listed include garlic powder  onion powder  parsley  jalapeno  and  spices   Im not sure what other spices there are  but it sure tastes like lemongrass to me  yum  These chips are thick cut and very crunch  They come in a seriously heavyduty bag  I tried to open it like I do regular chip bags by pulling the two sides apart  no way  The bag is so thick I wondered if it was plastic  I started looking for the scissors and decided that any company that put their chips in a bag this nice must have provided a way to open it  Sure enough  there is a small slit on the top and the simple directions  tear here   So easy  Why didnt I think of that  Honey Dijon flavor  okay flavor  but both my girlfriend and I thought they left a bad aftertaste  The aftertaste is sort of like old cheese  presumably some folks like this  Im not a fancy cheese eater   and it lingers for at least an hour  Id give this flavor a rating of 2 stars out of 5   br    br   We have also tried the NY Cheddar flavor  4 stars   which we both liked better  and they didnt leave any longlingering or bad aftertaste   br    br   Id give the consistency of the chips 4 stars  The chips are crunchy  but also greasy enough that I keep a napkin near or wash my hands after eating Kettle Chips  For me  Kettle is the best brand on the market  They really know how to turn the humble potato into something fit for the gods  I didnt think anything could top their salt and pepper chips  but these are my new favorite  The flavors are pure and real  They go great with just about everything and are highly addictive  I hope they come out with a low fat version  their low fat chips are excellent but they need more flavors  Salt and vinegar chips are definitely my favorite type of any potato chip  These ones made by Kettle were very tasty and I enjoyed them thoroughly  I just wish there was a more healthy option with the same great taste  What I like about them   br   1  Very thick chips   br   2  No trans fat and all natural  according to the info on the bag   br   3  Flavor  but thats a subjective thing   br   4  2oz bags  which keep you from eating too much at one time  Just set a limit of 1 bag   br    br   Cons   br   As another reviewer said  theres a lot of oil in them chips  What I do is place a paper napkin on a plate and pour the chips on them  Wait a few mins before eating and the napkin will soak some of the oil off  It seems gross that there is so much oil on the chip that a napkin will soak it off  but its true  And at least this way  youll get rid of some of the oil  These are so tangy it prevents me from eating too many  a handful or two does the trick  Very crisp and savory  I usually love Kettle Chips  and love salt  vinegar  but these chips were way too vinegary for me  They do have the typical kettle chip crunch  but are too aggressively flavored for my taste  I have always been a fan of Kettle chips  When you open a bag of Kettle chips you know you are going to get quality  These chips are no exception and live up to the name printed on the package   br    br   The New York Cheddar chips have a very subtle flavor to them  You can taste the cheddar in them  but it doesnt smack you in the face like supermarket brand chips might  The taste lingers as well which is a definite plus   br    br   Another aspect about these Kettle chips is the fact every chip is nice and crisp  that crunch in your mouth  On top of that there are no burnt chips in any of the bags I have had since the purchase  The only negative I might have is that the flavoring of the chips is uneven  Some chips might pack a nice cheddar punch while another might taste rather plain  This isnt a big flaw as it happens when getting seasoned and doesnt ruin the bag at all   br    br   Overall the quality of the chips is fantastic  The flavor is great and you wont  be disappointed  especially if you are a cheddar lover  Tried many varieties of BBQ chips and hands down these are the BEST on the market  These R not too salty or greasy  Great crispy crunch  Plenty of good BBQ flavor with a hint of sweetness that all other brands fall short of  Every bag  after bag  is just as mouth wateringly delicious as the 1st   Kettle chis are the best ever  These used to be my favorite flavor until I tried their Salt and Pepper kind but Im sure this is just a personal preference   br    br   Crunchy  real potato chips  These chips have the right amount of crunch and I enjoy the taste  Chips are consistent and have a fairly even distribution of seasoning  I like the 2  oz size bags  just the right amount of chips  I subscribed to these  one case every three months  That comes out to about  5 a month for the convenience of having my favorite chips handy whenever I want  Because it seems FritoLay has managed to crowd out every other chip vendor from pretty much all my local stores this is the best way to ensure a steady supply of the items I want rather than the items FritoLay wants me to have  The two ounce bags are larger than you might be used to buying at the Subway  for example  which I find works very well  theyre large enough to be a good snack on their own  or you can even share a single bag over lunch  The size is perfect for ensuring these fantastically crunchy chips are always fresh  no chip clip needed   br    br   The only problem  I subscribed to four cases a year and having these yummy chips always in the pantry makes it really easy to increase ones Kettle chip consumption  Definitely have to hide the case from the kids  OK  I did read the reviews which ranged from splendid to awful  I took the plunge as I do like salty  and tangy flavors  No  I had never had these before I took the leap and ordered a case at a super price  They arrived quickly and in great shape with the sell by date FEB 2011  Umm  Im in the middle on these chips  they are OK but not something I cant live without  I love the crunch  the color  NO TRANS FAT  They are a little too vinegary for my taste  which is a lot coming from a kid that grew up eating pickled hardboiled eggs and pickled pigs feet   br    br   I havent tried them with a deli sandwich and a cold mug of beer which might improve the experience  This was the best deal ever  The delivery was fast  the chips are delicious and very fresh  Love it  My husband and I LOVE these chips  Personally I think the flavor is perfect  Try them for yourself  The barbeque flavor of these chips is really perfect  Just spicy enough  a hint of sweetness  just a little smokey  The chips themselves are extra crunchy and just thick enough to be substantial  but not hard  This makes for a wonderful snack or a great accompaniment for burgers  hot dogs or brats  chicken or just about any casual entree  I was hesitant to buy this at my local grocery store  Lunds  but they were on sale  so I bought a bag  Ive found that going beyond the simplyflavored chips  like cheddar or vinegar  usually results in disappointment  Tried the Thai or asianinspired chips by Target  Archer Farms  and they were awful  These Kettle Spicy Thai chips are just awesome  so much so  that Im considering buying them in bulk from Amazon  The taste is complicated and stimulates different parts of the palate  The taste sensations prevalent in real Thai food is baked into this chip  sweet  salty  spicy  Was sour in there too  I dont know  but this is a wellmade wellbalanced chip that is addicting  As a professional potato chip muncher  I see these as thee very BEST on the market  Rich taste and flavor   Almost impossible not to finish the entire bagThe true meaning of decadence  These are handsdown the absolute best Salt  Vinegar chips you can buy  They have a great  strong flavor that has left me addicted  These are certainly my favorite chips  I highly recommend trying them  Oh  I love these chips  And theyre so hard to find where I am  and when I do find them  theyre usually  12 more per bag for less  Great that these are so cheap here at Amazon  I LOVE these chips  It is a little weird to review potato chips  But these chips are great  The crunch is just right  plus they have just the right amount of salt  Not to salty not too bland  They are a little oily but thats ok  The best thing is the 2 oz package  When I buy a larger bag its harder to resist eating them all  This 2 oz package allows for a little  portion control   Be sure to use your scissors to open   cause these chips are packaged for freshness and dont open easily  Enjoy  In the past couple years I have eaten and reviewed several kinds and styles of chips  from the best Ive ever had to big disappointments  If you have eaten the LantChips varieties  there is no way that they are not the best as a group  the Kettle chips are rightly salted and I was so irritated by some Pringles products  Kettle has good flavor but the small size and overwhelming oiliness takes away from the flavors  All in all  its good to have choiceAmazon does not stock the LantChips all the time so there are some days that there is no choice  these chips are good  and bad  and create moral dilemmas constantly  If wou are strong at will  or having a large BBQ go for it  but as for me  i was in the habit of bringing a new bag to work every three days  had to put in a lot of time on the treadmill to make up for it  BEWARE Kettle Chips flavors can be hit or miss  Some of their flavors are terrible  But this is very simple and delicious  Probably one of their best flavors   br    br   Pros  Thick  crunchy potato chips with light salt that doesnt compromise on taste  ecofriendly business that isnt just giving us lip service  br    br   Cons  The occasional burnt chip and the bag is a pain to open  They have a tab that you can pull down but most of the time I end up tearing down the entire side of the bag  Use scissors instead  We bought these chips at a little sandwich shop in Sonoma while we were on vacation  I wasnt sure what to expect by the package  and at first bite I didnt know what to think  and then all of the flavors hit   br   Yum  They are a bit spicy  but nothing overpowering  Just lots of crunchy  sweet  spicy goodness  They arent sold everywhere though  Im still trying to find them somewhere close to where I live  I have to admit that those chips are so good that they are highly addictive  I cant stop eating them    Its crunchy and seasoned at the right amount of flavor and salt  Just perfect    Believe me  some chips are so salty  I cant finish a small bag  But this one  I just keep on eating  These are some of the best chips that I have ever had  They sure beat anything else out there and are even cooked in a way that is better for you than most other name brands  They are tangy and crisp and satisfy any craving at the time  These will be the only chips that I buy from now on and I thank amazon for letting me buy them online in bulk and save some money at the same time  Im addicted to salty and tangy flavors  so when I opened my first bag of Sea Salt  Vinegar Kettle Brand chips I knew I had a perfect complement to my vegetable trays of cucumber  carrot  celery and cherry tomatoes  Skip the dip  balance the tangy chips by alternating bites of raw vegetable   br    br   As an Oregonian  Im proud to share these delectable snacks with friends  especially those living outside our state and who havent

these parameters perfectly   These chips remind me of a long obsolete brand of chips we could get in middle school  They are by far the tastiest chips Ive had and its impossible to walk past the aisle without picking up the trademark blue bag and then putting the bag clip on the bag  These are by far my favorite chips  they are extremely crunchy  similar to other Kettle style chips   but its the extreme Vinegar flavor that differentiates these from lesser fried potato snacks  Ive tried several other brands of Salt and Vinegar and none of them come close  They are good but need more cheese and wish they were krinkle cut  I much prefer the salt  pepper just for the krinkle cut  they have a better texture  All around this brand is much better than FritoLay and a good price on Amazon when you get free shipping  These are similar to Tims or Zacks chips in that they are very crispy   br    br   On a side note  these are the hardest bags to open by hand  I have to use a knife or scissors everytime  It took a while to get used to these chips but they are pretty good and more healthy for you  They sure were eaten all up by my family and friends  These are delicious  The 2 oz bags are a bit big for school lunches  definitely more than a serving  I recently tried this flavor  brand and was surprised at how delicious these chips are  The best thing was that there were a lot of  brown  chips in the bsg  my favorite   so I bought some more through amazon and shared with family and friends  I am a little disappointed that there are not  so far  very many brown chips in these bags  but the flavor is still very good  I like them better than the yogurt and green onion flavor because they do not seem to be as salty  and the onion flavor is better  If you havent eaten Kettle chips before  I recommend that you try a bag before buying bulk  They are thicker and crunchier than Lays but just as fresh out of the bag  We are always pleased with Amazons packaging  Chips are never crushed or broken  always fresh  We really liked this brand  flavor of chips  Very tasty  These chips are some of the best Ive tasted  They are not filled with chemicals  You taste the tangy vinegar as well as the potato  Not greasy  Perfectly crispy  If you dont like salt and vinegar tanginess  dont even bother to try  These definitely have zip  I love them  My children and their friends love them  Even my 4 year old loves them  These chips were a great deal  Kettle was having a special deal for the case of chips  They are hard to find in Vegas and are my favorite flavor  Shipping was very fast  sooner than expected  fantastic  you can not beat this taste and you can not resist to it only one if you are spice lover Eat at your own risk  Once I would open a bag I could not stop  Good and salty  I dont eat many chips  but these I love  Great buy and arrived quick and packed great  Expiration date is a ways away  so I have awhile to enjoy them Great natural potato flavor  I love brown russet  hardy flavor and these fit that description to a tee  I simply fell in love with these chips and refused to share them with my friends    My experience with a lot of cheesefavored chips has been too salty and a little over the greasy side  But these NY Cheddar from Kettle really changed my mind  Thanks to Amazon for great discounts and I dont have to buy them from the store anymore  Bought this box of chips as a Fathers Day gift because Dad loves them  They are very yummy and more substantial than regular chips  These chips are quite tasty and the price is right  Packaged very well  would buy again  I like Kettle chips but was really disappointed with this order because they were over cooked  I bought a bigger sized bag from Costco and the chips were all cooked perfectly  So I dont know why these were different   br   Will never buy these chips from here again  For some reason Amazon would not ship these to Alaska   so I sent them to my grandchildren who got to enjoy them  They are very good chips  Amazon should rethink the shipping to Alaska thing  I would order groceries online  My husband likes these a lot  They are a bit different to get used to as they are less greasy and salty in taste than the usual chips you buy  They are more browner than I would like to see and the chips are pretty sturdy in texture  Not bad  though  Just takes getting used to eating chips better for your health  They do have about 12 the calories in fat  however  Just got this order and it is ok  A bit light on the cheddar flavoring and herb taste eludes me  if it is there  I really love Kettle brand chips  but these are rather disappointing  There is very little sour cream or onion flavor  I took one and said good Russet potato chip but I found that the flavoring was subtle for my taste  a bit oily and overcooked  It may be because I am use to eating their great tasting  a href   httpwwwamazoncomgpproductB000G6Q4GM   Kettle Chips Spicy Thai  2  Ounce Bags  Pack of 24  a  Or perhaps because all the chips in the bags I received were overcooked and that overpowered the seasoning  It is obvious the chips are flavored  but if I did not read the bag I would never have thought it had Cheddar flavor  And I love New York Cheddar  The flavoring included Parmesan  Cheddar  Blue Cheese  garlic and other spices  A good chip even when overcooked  but I do not plan to buy them again  I took one and said good Russet potato chip but where is the flavoring  Then all of a sudden  within seconds  it spread to my senses and my taste buds were happy  As close to Thai food as a potato chip can get  These chips are spicy enough to satisfy that craving for spice and a hint of sweetness that makes them habit forming  The flavoring included garlic  ginger  jalapeno  cilantro and other spices  and it just felt great to eat these  I will buy these again  These were a treat  I agree with the other review  these chips are not for a sore mouth or tender gums  The chips are very hard and the taste is delightful if you enjoy the salt  vinegar combo  Unfortunately  every bag I received in that case was over cooked  They were very dark and only a few golden brown chips in each bag  They definitely need to improve that  We love Kettle Chips Lightly Salted and dont feel guilty eating them  We used to buy them at Whole Foods but buying from Amazon has saved us money  We have purchased at least 3 times and have been happy with the chips and the delivery  A friend of mine brought these into work with the claim   these will change your life   While my life is fairly unchanged  I cannot get enough of these chips     and I do not even like kettle chips  For the most part  I find Kettle Chips to be too thick and greasy  but the flavor of these chips is amazing  The are the type of hot that is refreshing  If you do not enjoy spicy or hot things    try these anyway  they may convert you  But if you happen to  like me  there is no better sea salt and vinegar chip Ive found in this country  These are the best potato chips Ive ever tasted  Its easy to go through half of a bag without stopping  The texture  crunchiness is just perfect  as is the salt and vinegar combination  I dont know how they taste so much better than all of the other chips Ive ever had  but they do  And  judging from the nutrition facts  they seem to be healthier  too  Theyre somewhat fibrous and have a good bit of potassium and vitamin c  which could be because they dont skin the potatoes and the chips are a bit thicker than normal   br    br   And if you like these  all of the Kettle chips are great  i rarely eat chips but i saw these and tried them  they are really amazing  i love cheddar too  but the chips are really thin and crunch and delicious flavor  i recommend them  This is easily the best potato chip that I have ever had  Look at the ingredients  Ginger and 3 types of hot pepper  How can you go wrong   br    br   Obviously  not for you if you dont like spicy food  But  if you DO like spicy food  youll probably love these  They have that hotwithahintofsweetness flavor combo that is prevalent in a lot of Thai food  Kettle Chips Spicy Thai potato chips have the perfect amount of sweet  savory and spicy   everything youd want in a good meal or better yet  a potato chip  Since these are kettlecooked  the chips are uniquely shaped and are sometimes a bit overbrowned  They are  however  sliced just perfectly  not too thick  not too thin  so you can actually get a great crunch with each bite without breaking a tooth off  The flavor is tremendous  although I wouldnt describe it as Thai  Its more of a vague  sweet and tangy flavor with a kick  and every now and then you get a great big hit of ginger  If you like any spice at all  these really are not overly spicy  so most people can handle them  The fact that these chips have absolutely no artificial ingredients or trans fat makes them a fabulous addition to any munchers snack cupboard  Okay  I should not eat potato chips  nor should anyone   br   But these are so spicy  I would find it hard to eat  br   very many  That makes them an indulgence that  br   rescues some people from overindulgence  I dont write very many reviews but I have to say that Kettle Brand chips are the best I have ever tasted  Every flavor is dynamite  If you are feeling iffy about honey dijon  I would recommend cheddar beer  absolutely amazing  And theyre healthy   besides a lil fat  I have eaten a lot of chips in my day and Kettle takes the cake  Enjoy  and dont eat them too fast

       "'I have bought several of the Vitality canned dog food products and have found them all to be of good quality  The product looks more like a stew than a processed meat and it smells better  My Labrador is finicky and she appreciates this product better than most  Product arrived labeled as Jumbo Salted Peanuts  the peanuts were actually small sized unsalted  Not sure if this was an error or if the vendor intended to represent the product as  Jumbo   This is a confection that has been around a few centuries  It is a light  pillowy citrus gelatin with nuts  in this case Filberts  And it is cut into tiny squares and then liberally coated with powdered sugar  And it is a tiny mouthful of heaven  Not too chewy  and very flavorful  I highly recommend this yummy treat  If you are familiar with the story of C  S  Lewis   The Lion  The Witch  and The Wardrobe   this is the treat that seduces Edmund into selling out his Brother and Sisters to the Witch  If you are looking for the secret ingredient in Robitussin I believe I have found it  I got this in addition to the Root Beer Extract I ordered  which was good  and made some cherry soda  The flavor is very medicinal  Great taffy at a great price  There was a wide assortment of yummy taffy  Delivery was very quick  If your a taffy lover  this is a deal  I got a wild hair for taffy and ordered this five pound bag  The taffy was all very enjoyable with many flavors  watermelon  root beer  melon  peppermint  grape  etc  My only complaint is there was a bit too much red  black licoriceflavored pieces  just not my particular favorites   Between me  my kids  and my husband  this lasted only two weeks  I would recommend this brand of taffy   it was a delightful treat  This saltwater taffy had great flavors and was very soft and chewy  Each candy was individually wrapped well  None of the candies were stuck together  which did happen in the expensive version  Fralingers  Would highly recommend this candy  I served it at a beachthemed party and everyone loved it  This taffy is so good  It is very soft and chewy  The flavors are amazing  I would definitely recommend you buying it  Very satisfying   Right now Im mostly just sprouting this so my cats can eat the grass  They love it  I rotate it around with Wheatgrass and Rye too This is a very healthy dog food  Good for their digestion  Also good for small puppies  My dog eats her required amount at every feeding  I dont know if its the cactus or the tequila or just the unique combination of ingredients  but the flavour of this hot sauce makes it one of a kind

You Candy was delivered very fast and was purchased at a reasonable price  I was home bound and unable to get to a store so this was perfect for me  My husband is a Twizzlers addict  Weve bought these many times from Amazon because were government employees living overseas and cant get them in the country we are assigned to  Theyve always been fresh and tasty  packed well and arrive in a timely manner  I bought these for my husband who is currently overseas  He loves these  and apparently his staff likes them also   br   There are generous amounts of Twizzlers in each 16  ounce bag  and this was well worth the price   a href      Twizzlers  Strawberry  16  Ounce Bags  Pack of 6  a I can remember buying this candy as a kid and the quality hasnt dropped in all these years  Still a superb product you wont be disappointed with  I love this candy  After weight watchers I had to cut back but still have a craving for it  I have lived out of the US for over 7 yrs now  and I so miss my Twizzlers   When I go back to visit or someone visits me  I always stock up  All I can say is YUM   br   Sell these in Mexico and you will have a faithful buyer  more often than Im able to buy them

again I was so glad Amazon carried these batteries  I have a hard time finding them elsewhere because they are such a unique size  I need them for my garage door opener   br   Great deal for the price  I got this for my Mum who is not diabetic but needs to watch her sugar intake  and my father who simply chooses to limit unnecessary sugar intake  shes the one with the sweet tooth  they both LOVED these toffees  you would never guess that theyre sugarfree and its so great that you can eat them pretty much guilt free  i was so impressed that ive ordered some for myself  w dark chocolate  to take to the office so ill eat them instead of snacking on sugary sweets   br   These are just EXCELLENT  I dont know if its the cactus or the tequila or just the unique combination of ingredients  but the

Latte Macciato  No Coffee Shop has a better one and I like most of the other products  too  as a usually noncoffee drinker     br   The little Dolche Guesto Machine is super easy to use and prepares a really good Coffee  Latte  Cappuccino  etc in less than a minute  if water is heated up   I would recommend the Dolce Gusto to anyone  Too good for the price and Iam getting one myself   This offer is a great price and a great taste  thanks Amazon for selling this product   br    br   Staral McCanns Instant Oatmeal is great if you must have your oatmeal but can only scrape together two or three minutes to prepare it  There is no escaping the fact  however  that even the best instant oatmeal is nowhere near as good as even a store brand of oatmeal requiring stovetop preparation  Still  the McCanns is as good as it gets for instant oatmeal  Its even better than the organic  allnatural brands I have tried  All the varieties in the McCanns variety pack taste good  It can be prepared in the microwave or by adding boiling water so it is convenient in the extreme when time is an issue   br    br   McCanns use of actual cane sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup helped me decide to buy this product  Real sugar tastes better and is not as harmful as the other stuff  One thing I do not like  though  is McCanns use of thickeners  Oats plus water plus heat should make a creamy  tasty oatmeal without the need for guar gum  But this is a convenience product  Maybe the guar gum is why  after sitting in the bowl a while  the instant McCanns becomes too thick and gluey  This is a good instant oatmeal from the best oatmeal brand  It uses cane sugar instead of high fructouse corn syrup  so not only does it have a better sweetness  but some doctors now say that this form of sugar is better for you  Great on a cold morning when you dont have time to make McCanns Steel Cut Oats  The apple cinnamon is the best but the maple and brown sugar or the regular are good too  Plus they dont require doctoring to actually tell the three flavors apart  Instant oatmeal can become soggy the minute the water hits the bowl  McCanns Instant Oatmeal holds its texture  has excellent flavor  and is good for you all at the same time  McCanns regular oat meal is excellent  too  but may take a bit longer to prepare than most have time for in the morning  This is the best instant brand Ive ever eaten  and a very close second to the noninstant variety   br    br   McCanns Instant Irish Oatmeal  Variety Pack of Regular  Apples  Cinnamon  and Maple  Brown Sugar  10  Count Boxes  Pack of 6  McCanns Instant Irish Oatmeal  Variety Pack of Regular  Apples  Cinnamon  and Maple  Brown Sugar  10  Count Boxes  Pack of 6   br    br   Im a fan of the McCanns steelcut oats  so I thought Id give the instant variety a try  I found it to be a hardy meal  not too sweet  and great for folks like me  postbariatric surgery  who need food that is palatable  easily digestible  with fiber but wont make you bloat  For those of us with celiac disease this product is a lifesaver and what could be better than getting it at almost half the price of the grocery or health food store  I love McCanns instant oatmeal  all flavors     br    br   Thanks   br   Abby What else do you need to know  Oatmeal  instant  make it with a half cup of lowfat milk and add raisins  nuke for 90 seconds   More expensive than Kroger store brand oatmeal and maybe a little tastier or better texture or something  Its still just oatmeal  Mmm  convenient  I WAS VISITING MY FRIEND NATE THE OTHER MORNING FOR COFFEE  HE CAME OUT OF HIS STORAGE ROOM WITH  A PACKET OF McCANNS INSTANT IRISH OATMEAL   HE SUGGESTED THAT I TRY IT FOR MY OWN USE  IN MY STASH  SOMETIMES NATE DOSE NOT GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO SAY NO  SO I ENDED UP TRYING THE APPLE AND CINN  FOUND IT TO BE VERY TASTEFULL WHEN MADE WITH WATER OR POWDERED MILK  IT GOES GOOD WITH O  J  AND COFFEE AND A SLICE OF TOAST AND YOUR READY TO TAKE ON THE WORLD  OR THE DAY AT LEAST  JERRY REITH  I ordered this for my wife as it was reccomended by our daughter  She has this almost every morning and likes all flavors  Shes happy  Im happy     br    a href      McCANNS Instant Irish Oatmeal  Variety Pack of Regular  Apples  Cinnamon  and Maple  Brown Sugar  10  Count Boxes  Pack of 6  a The variety packs taste great   br    br   I have them every morning  At  030 cents per meal  I dont understand why everyone on earth isnt buying this stuff up   br    br   Maple and brown sugar is terrific  followed by apples and cinnamon  followed by regular  You dont get tired of the same ole thing  and they taste great   br    br   I just boil water from a small pot  empty the packet or 2 in a bowl  pour in boiling water  and watch it expand to 2x its size   br    br   Taste really good and takes minutes to prepare   br    br   Not sure why everyone on earth isnt this  Convenient  healthy  very quick  excellent quality  and extremely cheap  McCanns makes oatmeal for every oatmeal connoisseur  whether one likes it from the raw pellet state that cooks for half an hour  to the sloth addled instant  which can be done in the microwave for under three minutes  Its all good  thats for sure  and the beauty of the instant variety is that it is available in different flavors as well as regular   br   This variety pack allows different tastes to be explored  as well as giving you a chance to experience the difference between McCanns and other wellknown oatmeals  What I personally like about McCanns is that it cooks up thicker and with more body than the top brand here in America  The Apples  Cinnamon  though  tends to be a little liquidy so you may want to experiment with the amount of water you add  In my 1300watt microwave the oatmeal cooks up in about one minute and twentyseven seconds  so you should also watch that to get a handle on how much time and water to use   br   The only bad thing   if you can consider it a bad thing   about this offering is that you have to buy in lot so youll end up with six tencount boxes  This is good if you have a whole family of oatmealeaters  but if youre a single person alone   well  love oatmeal  I have McCanns Oatmeal every morning and by ordering it from Amazon I am able to save almost  300 per box   br   It is a great product  Tastes great and very healthy McCanns Oatmeal is a good quality choice  Our favorite is the Apples and Cinnamon  but we find that none of these are overly sugary  For a good hot breakfast in 2 minutes  this is excellent  We really like the McCanns steel cut oats but find we dont cook it up too often   br   This tastes much better to me than the grocery store brands and is just as convenient   br   Anything that keeps me eating oatmeal regularly is a good thing  This seems a little more wholesome than some of the supermarket brands  but it is somewhat mushy and doesnt have quite as much flavor either  It didnt pass muster with my kids  so I probably wont buy it again  Good oatmeal  I like the apple cinnamon the best  Though I wouldnt follow the directions on the package since it always comes out too soupy for my taste  That could just be me since I like my oatmeal really thick to add some milk on top of  The flavors are good  However  I do not see any differce between this and Oaker Oats brand  they are both mushy  I really like the Maple and Brown Sugar flavor  The regular is fine with brown sugar added  The Apples and Cinnamon flavor is OK  This is a very quick  easy and satisfying breakfast and Ill order this brand again  but not the variety  Ill get all Maple and Brown Sugar  This is the same stuff you can buy at the big box stores  There is nothing healthy about it  It is just carbs and sugars  Save your money and get something that at least has some taste  This oatmeal is not good  Its mushy  soft  I dont like it  Quaker Oats is the way to go  Got a free package of these with a bottle of bloody mary mix I bought from the seller  and the advertising worked  lol  I tried them  and shared them with 2 buddies  and we all loved them  So im here to buy more  and noticed there were no reviews yet   well now there is  They are Hot  but not  burn your mouth forever hot  its a nice temp  Perfect for us  This wasnt in stock the last time I looked  I had to go to the Vermont Country Store in Weston to find it along with a jaw harp  Cranberry Horseradish Sauce  Fartless Black Bean Salsa  Apple Cider Jelly  Newtons Cradle Art in Motion and the staple Vermont Maple Syrup   br    br   Back to the Ass Kickin Peanuts  They are hot  They will activate the perspiration glands behind your ears and under your arms  It requires a beverage as advertised  a glass of very cold milk  and a box of Kleenex since it will make your nose run  They look like ordinary peanuts which is already giving me ideas for work  I suspect that some people have been hitting my goodies in my absence  especially my colleague Greg  Im going to take this to work at earliest opportunity and empty the contents of this can into an ordinary Planters Peanuts can  and then see whose crying or whose nose is running when I return   br    br   The can should be shaken to ensure the spices are evenly distributed  It is important to wash your hands after consumption and not touch the eyes   br    br   Youll go nuts over these AssKickin  Peanuts   br    br   P  S  Im not sharing the peanuts  not deliberately  and Ill probably give Greg the jaw harp for Christmas  Hell be so insulted  were used to spicy foods down here in south texas and these are not at all spicy  doubt very much habanero is used at all  could take it up a notch or two  I roast at home with a stovetop popcorn popper  but I do it outside  of course   These beans  Coffee Bean Direct Green Mexican Altura  seem to be wellsuited for this method  The first and second cracks are distinct  and Ive roasted the beans from medium to slightly dark with great results every time  The aroma is strong and persistent  The taste is smooth  velvety  yet lively  We roast these in a large cast iron pan on the grill  about 13 of the bag at a time   The smell is wonderful and the roasted beans taste delicious too  More importantly  the coffee is smooth  no bitter aftertaste  On numerous occasions  weve had to send the roasted beans home with friends because they like it so much  Deal was awesome  Arrived before Halloween as indicated and was enough to satisfy trick or treaters  I love the quality of this product and it was much less expensive than the local stores candy  It is chocolate  what can I say  Great variety of everything our family loves  With a family of six it goes fast here  Perfect variety  Kit Kat  Reeses  take five and more  Great product  nice combination of chocolates and perfect size  The bags had plenty  and they were shipped promptly  The kids in the neighborhood liked our candies  Halloween is over but  I sent a bag to my daughters class for her share  The chocolate was fresh and enjoyed by many  Watch your prices with this  While the assortment was good  and I did get this on a gold box purchase  the price for this was  br    34 less at Target  This bag of candy online is pretty expensive  it should be cheaper in order to compete with grocery stores  other than that  its a good combination of my favorite candy Arrived in 6 days and were so stale i could not eat any of the 6 bags   I have used the endurolyte product for several years in both pill and powder form  Long desert rides on the dirt bike always found my camelbak water heavily laced with the endurolyte powder  not overly tasty  but quite effective  as I never got a cramp on these several hundred mile rides  Same for desert racing in the buggy  the camelbaks were always laced with the powder  Now we have the Fizz  what a great product  Firstly  its Hammers endurolyte product so its great  endurance athletes the world over use their products  Second its convenient  handly tablets that dissovle in a fizz  Third it tastes great  Imagine getting a nice cool drink when your body is starving for hydration and electrolytes and rather than getting a  salty  taste  you get a refreshing lemonlime or mango  The camelbaks always get the Fizz now  I also drop a tablet in my bottled water whenever I exercise and have a nice flavored water chock full of electrolytes  I cannot recommend this product or any hammer product highly enough  This product serves me well as a source of electrolytes during and after a long run or bike ride   br   I have tried all of the flavors but really do like the grapefruit flavor  no aftertaste and I actually like the slight carbonation   br   I use other Hammer products and really like their whole product line  This stuff really works for preventing cramping during the middle to latter stages of your rides  Pop 1 into each water bottle and youre set  Flavor is fine and goes down easy  For those of us on a low carb diet these little tablets are just the thing   br    br   Two years ago I started cycling again after many years but was having heart arrhythmia after longer rides in high heat  I was drinking plain water but did a little research and thought electrolytes might be the issue  Gatorade wasnt an option because it is so loaded with carbohydrates so I looked around for a lowcarb alternative  The  zero carb  sports drinks didnt help so what to do  One day I ran across these at my bike shop so tried a tube of them  voila   problem solved    br    br   Ive shared them with two friends in particular whose problems with leg cramps were resolved while using these   br    br   These guys got it right   they are superbly formulated and simply work  I purchased the Mango flavor  and to me it doesnt take like Mango at all  There is no hint of sweetness  and unfortunately there is a hint or aftertaste almost like licorice  Ive been consuming various sports nutrition products for decades  so Im familiar and have come to like the taste of the most of the products Ive tried  The mango flavor is one of the least appealing Ive tasted  Its not terrible  but its bad enough that I notice the bad taste every sip I take  If youre impulsive like me  then  6 is ok  Dont get me wrong  the quality of these babies is very good and I have no complaints  But in retrospect  the price is a little ridiculous  esp  when you add on the shipping   this was sooooo deliscious but too bad i ate em too fast and gained 2 pds  my fault These Albanese gummi bears and rings and so on are very good and tasty and high quality  The bears even have little faces  At my local candy store this type of gummi stuff  bears  rings  snakes  balls  worms  whatever  are about  10  lb  These twin packs of 45 or 5 pound bags is a screaming deal as far as Im concerned  Im probably 50 pounds deep in these friggin  things  Consumed  Grape gummy bears are hard to find in my area  In fact pretty much anyone I talk to about grape gummy bears they think Im lying  So I bought 10lbs    These bears are a little bit bigger then the other brands and have kind of sour kick  but nothing to strong  I love grape flavored candy  soda and these are pretty good  There is another company that makes grape gummy bears that are a little bit better in my opinion  but these are well worth it for the price  I like to use the gummy bears in home made Popsicles with flavored sports drink  The salt in the sports drink makes for softer popsicles  and the gummy bears are awesome frozen  They are delicious  I ordered two of these and two of raspberry latice tarts directly from FantasiCakes website for a dinner party I was hosting  It arrived fresh and intact  Very good size  I froze half for later use  I am a pastry lover and these were the best Ive ever tasted  The pastry was soft  the jam was really good and the taste was great  They were gone in no time  My guests were really impressed  Buyer Beware Please  This sweetener is not for everybody  Maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body  You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience  Nausea  diarrhea  headaches can also be experienced  I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugarfree chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell  I thought Id found sugarfree chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in  The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before  I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping  As the symptoms passed  this too was very unpleasant  Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit  all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate  My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugarfree popcorn at my local market  The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy  new sugarfree treat taste so good  my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener  down to the very bottom of the label and read  maltitol  in tiny little letters  Thank goodness Id eaten only a little  I still ended up with all the same sideeffects but for a much shorter duration  Some people can use maltitol to their hearts content but others  like me  can have a bad reaction to it  In case youre like me   its not you  its the maltitol  It is okay  I would not go out of my way to buy it again No tea flavor at all  Just whole brunch of artifial flavors  It is not returnable  I wasted 20  bucks  These looked like a perfect snack to through in with my trail mix  Unfortunately  they arrived in a solid mass of melted chocolate  I left them in my pantry for a few days  and when I opened them at room temperature they were still gooey  I through them in the fridge and Ive been breaking off hunks ever since  They taste good to me  but the chocolate is all grainy after melting and then solidifying again  I wont order them online again  but if I see them in a store I would pick them up  These taste really good  I have been purchasing a different brand and these are very similar in taste and texture  I agree with the other reviewer regarding ordering in the summer  There is no insulating packaging with ice packs so they will melt in warm weather like all chocolate food items  Order in cold weather and buy enough to last    The taste was great  but the berries had melted  May order again in winter  If you order in cold weather you should enjoy flavor  i know i cannot make tea this good  granted  i am not from the south but i know i have never enjoyed tea that was this sweet without being too sweet  it tastes crisp  This peppermint stick is delicious and fun to eat  My dad got me one for Christmas because he remembered me having a similar one when I was a little girl  Im 30 now and I love it  Great gift for all ages  I purchased these giant canes before and the recipients loved them so much  they kept them and would not eat them  I know the product title says Molecular Gastronomy  but dont let that scare you off  I have been looking for this for a while now  not for food science  but for something more down to earth  I use it to make my own coffee creamer   br    br   I have to have my coffee blonde and sweet  but the flavored creamers are full of the bad kinds of fat  and honestly  I hate to use manufactured  food  items  I really dont think they are good for the body  On the other hand  I hate using cold milk or cream  because I like HOT coffee   br    br   I stumbled across this on Amazon one day and got the idea of making my own creamer  I also bought lowfat  noninstant  milk powder and regular milk powder  The noninstant lowfat milk is a little sweeter and tastes fresher than regular instant lowfat milk  but does not dissolve good in cold water  which is not a problem for hot coffee  You will have to play with the ratios  I would not do just the heavy cream  it made the coffee too rich  Also  I think the powder is too expensive to just use on its own  I like mixing 13 of each together   br    br   For flavoring  I bough cocoa bean powder  vanilla bean powder  and caster  superfine  sugar  I mix up small batches along with spices like cinnamon and nutmeg to make my own flavored creamers  If you wanted  you could use a fake sweetner powder instead  I make up small amounts that I store in jelly canning jars  I also use my little food chopper  food processor to blend everything  so the sugar is not heavier and sinks to the bottom  Let it settle for a bit before opening the top though   br    br   This stuff tastes WAY better than the storebought creamers and it is fun to experiment and come up with your own flavors  I am going to try using some essential oils next and see if I can get a good chocolate  orange mix   br    br   All of the ingredients I mentioned are here online  Take the time to experiment  Maybe you dont use any lowfat milk  Or dont add any flavorings  It is up to you  Also  would make great housewarming  host  ess  gifts   br    br   I am sure other molecular people will be able to tell you more of what you can do with it  and I am sure I will experiment with it in cooking  but the main reason I bought it was to make my own creamer and it worked out great  While my dogs like all of the flavors that we have tried of this dog food  for some reason their itching increased when I tried the lamb and rice  I have some very itchy dogs and am giving them a limited ingredient dog food to try to help  The duck and sweet potato cut down on the itching significantly  but when we tried lamb and rice they started itching more once again  I like Natural Balance for the quality ingredients  Awesome dog food  However  when given to my  Boston   who has severe reactions to some food ingredients  his itching increased to violent jumping out of bed at night  scratching  As soon as I changed to a different formula  the scratching stopped  So glad Natural Balance has other choices  I guess you have to try each  until you find whats best for your pet  We have three dogs and all of them love this food  We bought it specifically for one of our dogs who has food allergies and it works great for him  no more hot spots or tummy problems   br   I LOVE that it ships right to our door with free shipping  My dog has a ton of allergies both environmental and food  She was on a prescription dog food before we had her tested to see what allergies she has  After we got the test back  we learned she was allergic to something in the prescription brand  So I finally found this dog food and she has done so well on this  She still has her environmental triggers  but I am happy she can finally eat something I know wont cause her pain  My shepherd  collie mix has IBS  Our vet recommended a limited ingredient food  This has really helped her symptoms and she likes it  I will always buy it from Amazon  its  10 cheaper and free shipping  Natural Balance Dry Dog Food Lamb Meal and Brown Rice Recipe did wonders for my Jack Russell  She has awful food allergys and this food was our last hope because it was the last food we could find that didnt have SOMETHING in it that she was allergic to  She has no problem eating it dry but normally I mix the Natural Balance Dry Lamb and Brown Rice with the Natural Balance Wet Lamb and Brown Rice  she seems to like that better  We started feeding it to our other dog  a Bichon  too and she loves it  If your dog has allergys or stomach issue  or if you want your dog to eat better food   this is it  You will see a difference in your pet  Great food  I love the idea of one food for all ages  breeds  Ã \\x8e ts a real convenience as well as a really good product  My 3 dogs eat less  have almost no gas  their poop is regular and a perfect consistency  what else can a mom ask for   I have a standard poodle and pomeranian who both do wonderful on this food  I have switched them to a different food  due to price  a couple of times and end up going right back to natural balance  This is great dog food  my dog has severs allergies and this brand is the only one that we can feed him  This food is great  all ages dogs  I have a 3 year old and a puppy  They are both so soft and hardly ever get sick  The food is good especially when you have Amazon Prime shipping  My golden retriever is one of the most picky dogs Ive ever met  After experimenting with various types of food  I have found she loves natural balance  What I really like about natural balance is the fact that it has multiple flavors in dry and wet varieties  I mix her dry food with a little wet food and my golden loves it  Furthermore  I do like mixing up the flavors each time as I think the same meal day over day might get a little boring  so I figured why not  I tend to stay away from the fish type though as it smells   br    br   Additionally  I started purchasing off Amazon because Petco didnt have the wet food box and only had a couple of cans  I came home and to my surprise realized that I could save  20 each time I bought dog food if I just buy it off Amazon   br    br   All in all  I definitely recommend and give my stamp of approval to natural balance dog food  While I have never eaten it  my dog seems to love it  This is the same food we get at pet store  But its delivered to my door  And for the same price or slightly less  Ive been very pleased with the Natural Balance dog food  Our dogs have had issues with other dog foods in the past and I had someone recommend Natural Balance grain free since it is possible they were allergic to grains  Since switching I havent had any issues  It is also helpful that have have different kibble size for larger  smaller sized dogs  My 11  2 year old basenji  jack russell mix loves this dog food  Hes been noticeably healthier and more energetic since I switched him over from the standard dog foods earlier this year  Despite the higher cost of natural dog foods  I find that he eats significantly less of the Natural Balance dog foods and still stays happy and full  On the normal dog foods  hed eat up to 3 cups of dog food a day  the recommended serving for his size   whereas he only eats about 1 cup to 11  2 cup of the Natural Balance dog food a day  When you take this into account  youre actually getting more  bang for your buck  with the natural dog foods since you dont have to buy as much to last just as long as the normal dog foods  and a healthier  happier dog  to boot  Add in the fact that you can get free  2  day shipping with Amazon Prime  Im sold   Our pup has experienced allergies in forms of hotspots and itching from other dog foods  The cheap  you can buy it anywhere  food not only have crazy preservatives in them but can cause health problems for your pets  This food works wonders on reducing allergies and our dog loves the food   br   This message is RAMSEY FrAnkenSteiN approved  My English Bulldog had skin allergies the summer we got him at age 3  The vet recommended we wean him off the food his previous owner gave him  Iams Lamb and Rice  and onto a new kind  This was the second one we tried  and it has been working ever since  Its for dogs that need a limited diet who can be sensitive to additives and proteins commonly found in commercial dog food  like chicken or beef   I fed this to my Golden Retriever and he hated it  He wouldnt eat it  and when he did  it gave him terrible diarrhea  We will not be buying this again  Its also super expensive  The mouth says   How do I love thee  let me count the ways    br   If you like apple products a must have item  The only draw back  shipping cost  These are very heavy  Arrived slightly thawed  My parents wouldnt accept it  However  the company was very helpful and issued a full refund  The crust on these tarts are perfect  My husband loves these  but Im not so crazy about them  They are just too sour  tart for my taste  Ill eat the crust and hubby takes my filling  My kids think theyre great  so maybe its just me  These are absolutely scrumptuous  My husband and I both love them  however  as another customer put it  they are expensive to ship  The cost of shipping is more than the tartlets themselves are  What a nice alternative to an apple pie  Love the fact there was no slicing and dicing  Easy to prepare  I also loved the fact that you can make them fresh whenever needed  I like Creme Brulee  I loved that these were so easy  Just sprinkle on the sugar that came with and broil  They look amazing and taste great  My guess thought I really went out of the way for them when really it took all of 5 minutes  I will be ordering more  not what I was expecting in terms of the companys reputation for excellent home delivery products I first bought pickled asparagus at an Amish market and it was love at first bite  Hence  when I saw these on the discount rack at the local Safeway I cleaned it out  These are even better than the ones from the Amish market  They are fantastic  and some of the jars have a bonus clove of garlic at the bottom  Im going to order the six pack and Im a household of one  They wont go to waste  I love asparagus  Up until very recently  I had never had pickled asparagus  Oh my goodness  when a friend introduced me to this exact brand  I couldnt believe how great stuff tasted  I loved it so much I bought the six pack  Ive got 2 jars left  Gonna need more   Im presently on a diet and I was at my Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Grocery looking over possible diet foods  I wanted things that were tasty  nonfat and low in calories  I came home with about a dozen items  Thats how I discovered the Tillen Farms Pickled Crispy Asparagus  Well  Ive always liked asparagus anyway and Ive enjoyed several brands of pickled asparagus  This Tillen Farms brand is really  really good  Its the best I can recall  Theres an excellent flavor and a big clove of garlic down in the bottom of the jar which Im looking forward to eating  I cant believe how good this asparagus tastes and right on the front it says  only 60 calories per jar   Now this is my idea of a good diet food   br    br   Gary Peterson I was diappointed in the flavor and texture of this mix  I usually like most of the Low Carb things I have tried  but was diappointed in this specific one  I have been drinking this tea for a long time now  I used to have to purchase it at a doctors office because it wasnt available elsewhere  Im so glad that I can buy it now from Amazoncom  I drink this tea throughout the day like other folks drink coffee  Wonderful taste  I have been drinking Royal King 100  Natural Organic Green Tea  100 tea bags x 2g each  as my every day tea for several years now  I buy 12 boxes at a time to save on shipping  For many years I used to drink coffee from morning till night  But finally I realized that drinking so much coffee was not healthy for me  I finally resolved to improve my health and stopped drinking coffee all together  I tried many alternative drinks to replace my coffee habit  I found that green tea was not only good tasting it also has health benefits  Green tea is one of the few drinks that actually makes you healthier  coffe and other drinks do not   the only healthier drink is quality cold water  In my opinion  for the price  Royal King 100  Natural Organic Green Tea is one of the best tasting teas  This green tea has a beautiful golden color  the taste is bright and fresh  I recommend adding a tiny amount of Y  S  Organic Bee Farms RAW HONEY to the tea to add sweetness and health benefits too  I also give myself a treat once in a while by having a much more expense tea  Tribute Xi Hu Long Jing  but this fantastic tea is not practical for me to drink as my every day tea  although I would if I could afford it    br    br   Cons  On my latest shipment the package shown on the Amazon page is different than the one shipped  The one shipped displays  NATURALLY HIGH IN POLYPHENOL CATECHINS   a key contributive element to the possible health effects of tea   whereas the Amazon package displays  CAFFENE FREE   So I am not sure if this green tea is Caffene free or not  The other con is that sometimes the tea bag rips open when I unwrap the string from around the tea bag  So if the string seems stuck to the tea bag I put the bag in the hot water to unstick it  this has to be one of the best teas I have ever tasted  its clean  bright  fresh   br    br   great delivery  again quality  just try it  I love  love this green tea  It is very hard to find in our area and some places on the internet charge a big price and I usually dont get as many boxes as I did with this merchant  I will definitely order from this seller again   Thanks   I depend on my green tea fix everyday  I love this tea  It helps curb my eating during the day  My Mom and I have given it all friends to try  Im Italian and I lived in Italy for years  I used to buy these cookies for my everyday breakfast with an Italian espresso  I couldnt find them anywhere here in the Bay area  so its great to have them again  In the 1980s I spent several summers in Italy  This biscotti is often given as a breakfast food or midday snack  They are simple and delicious and were not sold in the US back then  They are so good that I brought back two bags from a recent trip to Italy  It is great to see that they may now be found on Amazon   br    br   Note  it is great to open a bag  smell the contents  pour a glass of milk  then dip the Macines in the milk  Great routine and treat for kids  I had heard a little about this product from the local pet store  then tried a small bag for our 2 cats of about 3 and 6 years respectively  The female  younger one took to it right away  and the older male  who was unfortunately weaned on the junk cat food with all the corn meal and etc  in it  and would usually refuse a diet change  actually liked it too  The older male is overweight and we were trying to switch him to soft food on the doctors request  but he totally refused it  He is a posh cat after all  He still consumes too many calories  the fatty  but at least I know hes eating good food  Of course  I know this product seems to cost more than most other feline food on the market  but I just cant see feeding our animals the lousy alternatives that are out there  marketed as being healthy  Why do commercials show cats eating a vegetarian diet which is mostly corn meal  Is that right  Ill stay with this for now  but stay tuned   br    br   Im updating this review after 9 months of using this cat food for our two cats  I upgraded the stars from 4 to 5 as it really has been a good food for the two of them  Garfield still eats a little too much  but hes just a big cat who doesnt exercise much  lets face it  Our female cat will be 4 years old in a couple months and shes so healthy  Shes tiny  but happy and agile  I tried the chicken version of Holistic Select  but Garfield seemd to miss this sardine version so we went back to this one  Ive ordered the duck version and will update this once they try it  I started buying this after I noticed my 1 year old cat was already starting to lose his  spunk  so I decided it was time to start buying him  real  cat food  not the garbage in the super markets  I found this at the pet store out of the other million choices  and Im sure there are other brands that are just as good but this is the one I went with to try first and it was a great purchase  My cat has been on this for the past 8 months and hes now just has active as he was when he was a kitten and his coat has became sooo soft  Mainly  he loved the taste even more  I highly recommend this brand to all my friends and family for their animals  I have done a lot of research to find the best food for my cat  and this is an excellent food  That is also according to my holistic veterinarian  They put probiotics on the kibble as the last step  which is very important to me  The best thing is that my cat loved it immediately and I had to stop mixing it with the old food because she only would eat Holistic Select  This cat food was recommended by my vet because my 13 year old Cleo Cat was having trouble keeping any food down and was loosing weight  It stopped her problems  She doesnt eat as much as before since she seems to be more satisfied after eating which helps justify the added price  It aids in digestion since the  ok sorry  smells are gone if ya know what I mean  Had to add that so anyone experiencing problems with their cats can see there are a lot of benifits from this cat food  I have a 4 year old male cat who has chronic urinary tract infections  I feed him this dry food in combination with wet food  with water added to it  and Uri Ease  The combination seems to keeps his UTIs under control  If I switch to another type of dry food  his UTI gets worse  The other cats seem to enjoy this food as well  Its expensive but it seems to be the best solution for me  Before I was educated about feline nutrition  I allowed my cats to become addicted to dry cat food  I always offered both canned and dry  but wish I would have fed them premium quality canned food and limited dry food  I have two 15 year old cats and two 5 year old cats  The only good quality dry foods they will eat are Wellness and Innova  Innovas manufacturer was recently purchased by Procter  Gamble  I began looking for a replacement  After once again offering several samples  from my local holistic pet store  Holistic Select was the only one  other than the usual Wellness and Innova  they would eat  For finicky cats  I recommend trying Holistic Select  It is a good quality food that is very palatable for finicky eaters  My holistic vet recommended this  along with a few other brands  We tried them all  but my cats prefer this  especially the sardine version   The best part is their coats are so soft and clean and their eyes are so clear  AND  and I dont want to be rude  so Ill say this as delicately as I can  their waste is far less odorous than cats who eat the McDonalds junk found in most stores  which is a definite plus for me  The health benefits are so obvious  I highly recommend Holistic Select  One of my cats is allergic to fish and beef  This formula is one of the few she can eat  and it has much better ingredients than the prescription diets available at the vet  Both of my kitties are very active  have soft shiny fur  and neither are fat  Dry food reduces tartar buildup on teeth  also  Our cats thrive extremely well on this dry cat food  They definitely have much less hair ball throw ups and their fur is great  They are fit and not over weight  This vendor ships extremely fast  Is one of the top Amazon suppliers in our book  Ive been a fan of Hot  Spicy Maruchan Ramen for a long time  If you enjoy spice  and love ramen  youll love this product  Too bad its way too expensive here on Amazon  Its only  336 per 12 at my Walmart  Ive been eating Ramen noodles since I was a little kid  and Ive never found a better flavor than Hot  Spicy Chicken  It isnt hot at all to a chilihead like me  but it sure is good  I LOVE spicy ramen  but for whatever reasons this thing burns my stomach badly and the burning sensation doesnt go away for like 3 hours  Not sure if that is healthy or not  and you can buy this at Walmart for  028  way cheaper than Amazon  Always being a fan of ramen as a quick and easy meal  finding it on amazon for a decent price and having it delivered to your door by the case is an amazing situation for anyone to find themselves in  I must be a bit of a wuss  because this soup tastes to me how I imagine fire might taste  Typically I like spicy food if it has a good flavor  I dont find this to be the case with this soup  Any flavor is killed off by the burn  I really loved the spicy flavor these had  I found myself liking the broth more than the noodles which is usually the opposite  If you arent used to the heat this might bother you and if you like hot hot foods this might not be enough  Got these on sale for roughly 25 cents per cup  which is half the price of my local grocery stores  plus they rarely stock the spicy flavors  These things are a GREAT snack for my office where time is constantly crunched and sometimes you cant escape for a real meal  This is one of my favorite flavors of Instant Lunch and will be back to buy every time it goes on sale  i have bought allot of different flavors and this happens to be one of my favorites and will be getting more soon I love this flavor of ramen  I dont eat other flavors anymore because they taste too bland by comparison  For the convenience of having it delivered to my home  I have prime  so I get it in two days and dont have to pay for the shipping   the price on amazon isnt bad at all  but it is still cheaper to run down and pick up a case of this at the grocery store  The BEST investment Ive ever made for ginger  Its unbelievable  Its fibrous like the real ginger  has that spicy kick to it  but its perfect with the sugar  calms it down  Its very worth the  40 for 5lbs of it  Ill be getting more soon  I use these as a topper for my ginger cupcakes and cookies  Delicious  I cannot get Australian ginger where I live  This compares favorably to Australian Ginger Ive purchased in other cities  Now I can enjoy it without traveling  I keep trying other brands  cheaper brands  Stupid me  This ginger IS soooo worth the money  Tender  moist and never a let down  My son has had acid reflux since birth and has been on every medication available with no improvement  Until an older gentleman came into his work place and told him about this product and I automatically ordered it for him  I was really not expecting any better results than the 1000 other things we have tried  What a surprise  He has not had any heartburn or symptoms since day 2 of starting eating one piece of this Ginger each morning  He can now eat anything and actually enjoy it  This product was a God send for him  Thank you all for it  I bought this for our office to give people something sweet to snack on  Because its bite size its easier for people to grab a couple a pieces rather than an entire licorice stick  My only complaint is that one of the bags broke open in shipping  Twizzlers brand licorice is much better than that other well known brand   br   If you can get these for  2 to  250 a package with free s  h its a good deal   br   The black and cherry have good taste  but the strawberry taste was too delicate and barely there I love these  very tasty    Infact  I think I am addicted to them   br   Buying them in packs of 6 bags  is very reasonable than going to Target and getting a bag  Savings are about a  100 a bag  I use subscribe and save on these and several other product  I love subscribe and save    If you are looking for a less messy version of licorice for the children  then be sure to try these  Theyre soft  easy to chew  and they dont get your hands all sticky and gross in the car  in the summer  at the beach  etc  We love all the flavos and sometimes mix these in with the chocolate to have a very nice snack  Great item  great price too  highly recommend  I might be mistaken  but it appears that the pieces in this bag were reduced in size  If they did do that  it was doubtlessly done to make it appear that the buyer got a better deal  having so many pieces after all  The problem is that the pieces have to be a certain size in order to have enough flavor for your eating experience  As it is  you have to use 2 or 3 pieces to match the old piece size  it is not the same  Being a fan of Newmans Pineapple salsa for quite a while  I was looking for a comparable salsa  This is one of the best tasting salsas Ive ever had  My daughters love it too  They dont like super chunky salsa and the Berry Mango has a nice smooth texture with small mango pieces  The salsa is not too sweet  just sweet enough and although its mild  it has a nice little kick to it  At this price  its a steal  The SALSA smelled delicious  as I think it probably was  but  unfortunately  the person  at AMAZON  that is a packer  there is probably several  had very little  stuffing  to work with  especially on the bottoms  Therefore  the bottoms were broken on all three bottles  As I reached for my computer  I was told NO RETURNS  cause its a food item   I then looked for a CUSTOMER SERVICE tag  and I found  none  on their NEW FACE LIFT  THEY SEEM TO BE PROUD OF THEIR NEW FACE LIFT BUT  THEY SHOULD AT LEAST HAVE A PLACE TO CONTACT THEM IN EMERGENCIES  LIKE  I BUY A LOT OF  STUFF  AND IT ALL COMES IN STYROFOAM BOXES  NEVER WOULD I SHIP THINGS  br   ESPECIALLY SALSA  IN A CARDBOARD BOX WITH JUST A STRIPE OF LARGE BUBBLE WRAP ON IT  NO MATTER HOW MUCH THE CARRIER  FED EX  IS CAREFUL  ITS GOING TO BREAK SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE  ESPECIALLY IN AN ALL GLASS CONTAINER  BARBARA L  S  This is one of the best salsas that I have found in a long time but stay away from the variety pack  The other two that come with it are not worth your money  These remind me of dog treats I made once using pumpkin and cinnamon  Theyre kind of bland and not my favorite Back To Nature product  But my finace really loves them so thats where the three stars come from  This is the best cornmeal  I made regular cornbread and hot water cornbread with this meal and both were outstanding  Also fried some oysters with this meal  it gave them a great texture and flovor  This is a fabulous marinade  I love to use it for chicken  either baked in the oven OR on the grill  This has enough flavor  flair  Ive even used it for dinner parties  only to receive rave reviews from my guests   DEFINITELY worth the price  Super cheap and super easy  Love it  Works with chicken fish beef or pork  Fast easy and makes it taste excellent  Plus buying in bulk is more than 50  off from box stores Got this for my brother who is on Jorge Cruise diet and decided to try one for myself  It actually tastes pretty good  These singles sell for  250   336 at the store for 1 box of 24 singles  Im not sure why Amazon is selling it for  999 for a box of 24 singles  Hazelnut coffee creamer is my favorite  but truly this is not a good buy  AWESOME    such a yummy flavor I got it as a healthy alternative to the desserts we normally eat and I am so glad that I did there are so many things you can do with Jello desserts and still have them taste good and be good for you  I will definitentally be purchasing this product again the flavor was so wonderful  I went to 4 grocery stores looking for this flavor of Jello for my green tomato jam recipe and finally found it here  This jello is wonderful  Evidently its only carried in the stores during the summer but with harvest time in the Fall  I couldnt find it anywhere in town  This Jello tastes like watermelon and the jam recipe I made with it takes like watermelon jam  Great made as regular Jello too  Yummy  What a deal this is the healthiest salt you can use  This box should last our family the year no problem  Iodized sea salt will not raise your blood pressure as regular salt will  Perfect size sea salt for the table or the picnic basket  We love it  Shakes well  no clumping and flows freely   span class   tiny   Length  026 Mins  br    br   span The expiration date is 21 months from the day I bought this product  The tuna  tomato combination is delicious  This is one of the many items I reorder on Amazon every month or so   br   edit  added a short video  so you see what this combination looks like   br    br   I was wearing one of those headlamps  but I didnt do a good job focusing on the tuna   br   I should film it over  but it doesnt look like many people view this product anyway  Ive never heard of the SAFCOL brand before but I was tired of only trying the typical pouches  Starkist and Chicken of the Sea  I was really surprised as I thought it was a bit better than the other brands and with less seasoning  these are the best tasting tuna pack they make in my opinion  make a great on the go snack  and really satisfying with the tomato I have always purchased StarKist tuna but thought I would try this brand for a change of pace  The taste of the tuna was not pleasant  too much basil and other spices for me  Im not familiar with the Safcol brand but being a tuna addict  gave this a shot  The tuna tastes like its good quality but I found the tomato basil flavor to be a bit bland  Its better than something plain but it didnt pack the punch I was hoping for  Its still a great option for a low calorie  low fat meal  I found it much tastier than the plain tuna pouches out there  Excellent quality  and no need to  dress it up    br    br   I put it the micro on about 20  power for 1 minute and Shazam   br    br   I believe a little heating brings out the flavor  Seriously this product was as tasteless as they come  There are much better tasting products out there but at 100 calories its better than a special k bar or cookie snack pack  You just have to season it or combine it with something else to share the flavor  I read about pomegranate molasses so I had to try it  I havent made anything with it yet  just eaten a little bit at a time but WOW is it decadent  Its dark  syrupy  sour  and a little sweet  A dab of this and I forget about dessert  Its just a really unique flavor with a pleasing metallic undertone  Yum   Im going to try making fesenjan next  Used this in Moroccan recipes  as a syrup in a brilliant mixed beverage and as a swirled topping on sliced oranges soaked in orange water  Wonderful  wonderful stuff  I dont know how long these sat on the back of a shelf somewhere  but they were so old that they wouldnt cook  I had to throw half of them out  because the skins were damaged  a clear sign of dried beans past their prime  I cant even return these or ask for a refund  because food is not returnable  Will find a different brand to use  For now  I have about fifty servings of beans to throw away  Besides being smaller than runts  they look the same and have the same consistency  Unfortunately  they taste nothing like banana runts  nor do they even taste good  Yucky stuff  Trying to return with vendor  The item over all was fine  but the Banana Heads are not just like Banana Runts they are alot smaller  Also when I received the item  the packaging was not great  The Banana Heads had come open during shipping and were all over the packing envelope  I purchased as a giveaway for a baby shower with Jungle theme  They worked out perfect for 25 small bags of candy  I purchased 5   If you want more than 25 small bags  I would purchase a larger bag  I have drunk Ricore since my mother allowed be to drink caffeine  I love this stuff in milk   br   Its much smoother and tastier than instant coffee with milk  I am French and live in the US   br   and bring back boxes of Ricore at every opportunity  Savora is another hidden gem you can bring  br   back  Check it out  I first had this drink when my mother brought it back with her from a visit to her home in Brittany France and thought it was delicious  I wish it were a bit cheaper but other than that  I love this product  I couldnt wait to try the 8 ″ Cinnamon Coffee Cake because it is made with fresh eggs  creamy sour cream  Madagascar Bourbon Vanilla and is topped and filled with cinnamon streusel  This 8 ″ Cinnamon Coffee Cake is available online for only  1895  Now  I have had my fair share of cinnamon coffee cakes  but  let me just tell you that the FantasiCakes Cinnamon Coffee Cake really  takes the cake  with size  price  quality and taste   br   The cake arrived very fast and was carefully packaged so that it arrived in almost perfect condition  It also comes with a large tub of white icing that you can drizzle over the top  before serving  I couldnt believe how large the size was and it actually fed my family of 5 for us to enjoy during breakfast  for three days  The cake itself is thick and almost has a solid but sponge cake type consistency that is really moist and very filling  The flavors are to die for with the sticky cinnamon outside and sweet cinnamon and vanilla swirled throughout the inside of the cake  The icing really tops it off beautifully and gives it that moist and sticky sweet flavor  Pair the cake with your morning coffee and youve got the perfect breakfast treat  I used to love these growing up and stopped drinking water and lemon juice from this brand about 56 years ago  This stuff used to be so strong i used to just pour some in my mouth and get that alive feeling going  It feels like the product went through changes which added more water or something to make it not so strong  The stronger it is the less you use as well  The product is still really good but the taste is the same quality as the cheaper brand names almost  I thought these would go fast but hey all lemon stuff i love unless it goes bad  This is a good product just wish it still had that hit me in the mouth chug sensation it used to be like  One of the best lemon juice that I have tried  I am recurring customer due to the high quality of this product  When the season for fresh lemos is out  this one supplement our need for the citrus on the kitchen or refreshments   br    br   I will continue buying it  This lemon juice is a must in my kitchen yearround  It has a powerful flavor and you dont need much of it to zest up a dish  I add a spritz of it to my water nearly every day   br    br   I will buy this product again and again  Fast delivery and good product  This is the same lemon juice concentrate you can find in stores and its really handy to have around to add to sauces  dressings  etc  Such a pain to squeeze fresh juice everytime you need it  nevermind having the lemons on hand to begin with  This is not as good as the Frozen Lemon juice  but it is good  It has a slightly odd flavor  perhaps from a preservative  Sure wish I could order the frozen juice  Couldnt believe it when told how relaxing this beverage was  Seriously  drink it only if you are getting ready for a nap or bedtime  If you have plans to drive or perform any other activity not recommended   br    br   I feel my arms and legs almost tingle with relaxation  After a short time my eyes start to get droopy and I am in another place   br    br   Love this stuff  I bought these at Grocery Outlet here in the Seattle Tacoma are for  400 a case of tweleve not paying  3800 Yes 3 for a dollar  I like the taste not great but not bad either low calorie will buy more but not at this whacked out price  This is an great product  The taste is great  and it works exactly as described  Superb natural sleep aid  AMAZING  WE have been looking for  natural  ways to help us sleep since we always seem to be overloaded with stress and a busy schedule  Yes  wed probably be better served taking a yoga class  but this is a good second choice  This helps you fall asleep and stay asleep  I drank half the first night and that was plenty for me  After about 30 minutes  I was ready for bed  I woke up refreshed and with no sleepydrug hangover  so that is a huge bonus   br    br   I gave the product 3 stars  instead of the 5 it deserves  as their packing job was marginal at best  The product arrived with 2 broken bottles  which at this price is a  6 loss  The bottles are glass and all they did was wrap one layer of the smallbubbled bubble wrap around the case and placed it in a larger box with extra room to move around in that box  Big packing fail  but the product is awesome  We made chocolate chip cookies with BRM Garbanzo Bean Flour and the results were fantastic  The brown sugar and chocolate mask any bean taste that other reviews have mentioned  Our friends couldnt discern any difference from classic CCCs  The texture  body  and elasticity  meaning reduced tendency to fall apart that occurs with most other glutenfree flours  is nice and chewy   the same as CCCs made with regular flour  And an added bonus   the high protein and fiber level  I calculate 23 g fiber  cookie  fills you up so that you are satisfied with smaller servings and the glycemic index is significantly lower   br    br   I highly recommend this flour even if CCCs are the only thing you make with it  This is great stuff  Made some really tasty banana bread  Good quality and lowest price in town  We had trouble finding this locally  delivery was fast  no more hunting up and down the flour aisle at our local grocery stores  This packet of glaze is the secret to making those European style fresh fruit tarts  I am about to make one for a pie auction at church  after a friend requested that something  strawberry  should be offered  You can make the most amazing and relatively  healthy  fruit tarts by baking a base  layering it with uncooked  fresh  sliced fruit  then pouring over the madeup contents of one of these packets  They harden up at room temperature  hold the fruit together so you can slice the tart  and they let the beauty of the arranged fruit show through  Ive also seen this glaze used over cheesecakes  to hold a fruit topping in place  Personally  I do not like cheesecake  too rich for me  but a fruit glazed cheesecake is gorgeous  I will admit  To do this  slice fruit and layer it on the cheesecake while its still in the springform pan  Pour on the glaze  let it set up and then remove the springform  Youll have a clear layer of fruit on top of the cheesecake  Cherries  strawberries or sliced mangos are nice  but the best one I ever had used thin slices of lemons  that had been gently poached in sugar syrup before they were layered on the cake   br    br   I use a base of sponge cake  baked in a shallow form  but other bases can be pate sucre  a kind of French pastry that is a bit like a sugar cookie  that works well in those fluted  straightsided forms  You can also make minitarts in a muffin pan  prebaking each mold with a layer of pie crust  even commercial crust works  though again  I prefer pate sucre  it holds its shape better and is more substantial and has a better crumb   Just blindbake the muffin tins lined with pate  then pop them out and fill with fresh fruits  berries are great  and pour over the glaze  Some people put a layer of creme patisserie  which is a pastry cream like custard but stabilized with flour  below the fruit and I happen to think these taste best   br    br   If you get into baking  this glaze is a musthave on the shelf  The ingredients are vegan  tapioca starch  carrageenan  dextrose  cream of tartar  locust bean gum  so if you are looking to make a vegan tofu cheesecake  you can use this on top  as well as use it for fruit tarts with a nut crust base  My Scotties were full of hot spots and when I used this within a week all the hot spots were gone  The smell is kinda strong  but not bad  Its tolerablel  I bought this coffee because its much cheaper than the ganocafe and has the organic reishi mushroom as well as other healthy antioxidants  I didnt expect it to taste good  but it actually does  Ive only had it for a few days and for  5 its totally worth it  My sisters all take ganocafe but now Im introducing them to this less expensive similar coffee  I will follow up on this product in a few weeks   The coffee is very finely processed and the flavor is just alright  Nescafe and Mount Hagen are better  I bought this to try something other than these two  but I probably wont get this again  There is just a slight  vitaminy  taste  but its not overwhelming  Its also a bit pricey for what you get  This coffee is great because its all organic ingredients  No pesticides to worry about  plus it tastes good  and you have the healing effects for ganoderma  Like the other people mentioned  this coffee has a great taste  Ive tried different instant coffees before  but this one is one of the better ones  Another one of my favorites  if you want to try it out  though NOT organic   is  Africafe pure instant coffee  Tastes great  and gives me energy without the jitters  Love this product   br   However  I do wish it came in some sort of resealable jar or hard plastic container instead of a ziplock pouch because the ziplock ripped off and quit working after awhile  But the product is fantastic  just not crazy about the packaging  These little guys are tasty and refreshing   br    br   I usually eat salads for lunch which can do terrible things to breath  I eat 2 of these after lunch  because they are so small  and I find this sufficiently resolves the problem   br    br   Theyre sugar free  sugar can actually help the smelly bacteria grow  which is great and theyre tasty enough that I almost think of them as part of my lunch   br    br   This is a good bulk value buy and Id highly recommend the mints themselves  Cheers  I like these better than the regular Altoids  but theyre even more costly  so youd better like them  These little tins of sugar free mine mints were a great dealThere perfict for on the goFifty mints per tin is just the right amount to cary alongAnd there safer for your teeth than the ones with sugarThe price of twelve dollars was very resonableAlso there great for shareingIf you are looking for a mint try these onesYoull be glad you did  Pros   br    packaging  shipping  price  br    sold about a year before its expiration date  enough for me to eat  share 9 boxes   br    not too  fresh  like the regular wintergreen and not in a powdery form  its a real mint   br    br   Cons  none  Be careful not to eat too many of them in one day  as one of the chemicals in it is the same as that of a LAXATIVE    LOLOLOL    These mints are really strong and have a great taste  They are also a convenient size to carry in a pocket or purse  This is a huge supply of them  Im still working on these and have plenty to spare  Much more effective than buying one from the grocery store or 711 every time you want a mint  Even with small containers  they dont fill them up  These little tins are less than half filled and at the price charged it seems a ripoff  Is there some exotic ingredient as costly as gold contained in those tiny squares  Or how about the cereal ploy  they were filled at the factory but settled in transport   br   Can manufacturers be honest in their dealings  I love  and use the empty containers for medicine  advil in my purse  desk  suitcase  Also line with felt to keep earrings  Perfect little size to disguise small valuables when traveling and LOVE the mints  Tiny and powerful without burning my mouth  Received as shown  My mother in law likes these and Walgreens quit carrying them  It was great i could get them on Amazon  I keep a case of these in my office and always have at least a tin or two on my desk for visitors to help themselves to  Some folks stop by just to grab some mints and others pop them like candy while we meet  When I find someone who keeps coming back for more I just give them their own tin  One coworker asked me to save the tins for her so she could use them as pillboxes and safety pin boxes  Like I said  theyre a real hit  Since I wouldnt be able to keep my hands off a candy dish  this is a good alternative to have around and its nice to have them around if I have garlic for lunch  I gave the item 4 stars because they arent as tasty as the sugar version of the mints but what sugar free item is as good as its full sugar counterpart   and because of the fact that each tin is wrapped in plastic which seems like a waste and is irritating to remove  although I totally get why they wrap it  it still doesnt make it easy to deal with   The tiny Altoids are great for a quick breath freshening and the small box is great for portability  Its full  but compact   br    br   I havent run out yet  and probably wont for a couple months  but I cant wait to buy it again  I loved these Wintergreen Altoid Smalls so much  I had to come write a review  The packaging is small for convenience  and the Altoids are smaller as well with a square shape  blue hue  and even more delicious taste in my opinion  I definitely prefer them over the regularsize Altoids and will continue purchasing them  Highly recommended  Fresh scent and taste  Easy to eat one tin in few hours  I use them as favors and everyone loved them  Hard to find the wintergreen smalls  sugar free  as stores only have the red smalls  peppermint   such a common flavor   The wintergreen is refreshing and absolutely delicious  Driving cross country  if someone cuts me off  I turn to my daughter with my hand out and say  Wintergreen Me   She pulls one out  puts it in my hand  and all is right with the world  To me  these are nothing like the regular Altoids and are not breath mints  They are pleasanttasting little candies in a cute convenient tin  and thats as far as it goes  The mintiness is just not strong  and the wintergreens are definitely weaker than the peppermint minis  Im not a dragonbreath person  but still  one of these mints is too small to have any effect on my breath  Four or five will freshen my breath for a short while  maybe 15 minutes  At this point  I think the Icebreakers Frost mints are the best as sugar free breath mints  we have fed our cats a lot of stuff  These 2 boy cats are not picky eaters  They loved the Purina  They loved the Nutro  They loved the Iams  They love whatever we feed them   br    br   This review is based on what we  their affectionate owners love  After a certain age  we were instructed by the vet to consider senior foods  and lower carb foods  because the catties were fatties  We tried a few types of food  Some evinced no change  Some made the litter superstink  Some had too small a kibble and the cats barfed it up because they didnt have to chew it to swallow it   br    br   This Felidae has done the trick  No problems to speak of  It is consistent in the litter and bearable on the nose  The cats love it  The kibble is sized appropriate to chewing  And heres the kicker   br   After feeding the cats Felidae  their demeanor improved  Their coats are super soft and lush  both are new improvements we can directly attribute to this food  Were now loyal Felidae consumers   br    br   Additionally  the absence of corn product in the feed seems to lessen or remove the reactions of our friends with catallergies  I started my cat on Felidae Platinum about 3 weeks ago and she loves it  Shes an older cat  somewhat overweight  and had a grouchy temperament  I first mixed it with her previous food and she figured out which was which   she ate the Felidae and left the old food  Shes now been on just the Felidae for about ten days now  off the old food entirely  and she is a much sweeter  happier cat  I think it must agree with her better or be more easily digested  or something  In any case  I am a happy purchaser of Felidae  I dont agree with the previous reviewer that cats dont like it  Clearly  mine does  We have three cats  the youngest is about eleven years old  another is fifteen and our oldest is  well ancient  That is what the vet told us ten years ago  The youngest is a blob  When he lays down  he looks like a footstool  The other two are arthritic and skinny   br    br   Since we had such success with Canidae Platinum for senior dogs  I figured that wed give it a try for our cats  Id had them on low ash Purina One Urinary tract formula for their entire lives and thankfully we had no UT problems   br    br   Buster  the youngest  is still a blob after six months plus on Felidae for Senior and Overweight cats  However  the other two are now much more active and we can tell that they are really  feeling better  since we changed their food to Felidae  Even Prissy  the ancient one has started to play and tease the dogs by getting them to chase her  where before when she was on Purina One  all she wanted to do was to sleep   br    br   I think that if you can get your cat on this fairly early in their weight problems  itll be more effective   br    br   However  the glucosamine will certainly help your older fur balls have a happier life  Too much of a good thing  We worked this kibble in over time  slowly shifting the percentage of Felidae to national junkfood brand until the bowl was all natural  By this time  the cats couldnt keep it in or down  What a mess  Weve moved on  As with canidae  Felidae has also changed their formula  Cats do not like change when it comes to their food  And they just had to change it without putting it on their label  We noticed the color of the food had changed and so did the smell   As you will notice I have also reviewd the Canidae  and this all happened the same time the dogs were having issues    br    br   Prior to the change in food we had almost lost two of our cats because we had moved to a new home  If cats get  upset  because of a change in enviorment  or a loud noise they can stop eating  It depends on the cat  Two of them had stopped eating and had lost a lot of weight  We took them to the vet and it took months to get them back to normal  It has been a year since then and they are better  Then the formula for this food changed   br    br   We started to noitce they were not eating as much and it started to bug us  We asked the shop owner of the feed store and she had no knowledge of any change to the food  It wasnt until the we were in there with other customers yelling about their dogs food making their dogs sick  Right away we changed the cats food and they started chowing down and havent suffered one bit like our dogs have   br    br   Cats are sensitve animals and changes to thier food could cause them to stop eating  Anyone thinking of purchasing this food should not do it  We have 5 rescued and fixed cats  none of which are picky eaters and the change in this formula could have been the death of them had we not found out about the change in their formula   br    br   I urge anyone that has had these problems to go to the consumer affairs website and also the FDA website and write a letter to them to let them know how this has affected your animal  As with canidae they do not care how the change has affected my animals  and tell me not to buy it  This is just horrible  Dont buy just a few of these  I order these by the case  I cant even remember the first time I tasted an anchovy stuffed olive but I have tried several of the brands online and this brand is my favorite  I order these olives a lot  They are unlike any other olives out there  The subtle flavors of the brine go great with cheeses  One of my favorite appetizer treats for guests  Hey  the description says 360 grams  that is roughly 13 ounces at under  400 per can  No way  that is the approximate price for a 100 gram can  My husband and I are both kind of wimpy when it comes to hot things and this seasoning is just a bit too spicy for us  It definitely makes you sweat a bit when youre eating it  It was still edible to us by adding a good sized dollop of sour cream but I dont think I would buy it again due to the heat  We prefer the milder McCormicks brand of Fajita mix  Ive also had fajitas in a couple of different restaurants and it wasnt as spicy as this mix is   br    br   If you like super spicy then this is not burning hot so you might want to keep that in mind  To me it was more than medium hot but not by too much   br    br   I gave it three stars because it was pretty easy to make and its versatile in that you could vary the veggies you put in it  You take a plastic bag  a couple of tbs of vegetable oil  14 cup water and mix the seasoning  water and oil together then add the chicken strips to the bag and let it marinate for 5 minutes  In the meantime  it says to stir fry your veggies  peppers and onion  but I found it easier to just cook the chicken and veggies together and I dont think it affected quality or taste  I also used extra virgin olive oil rather than vegetable oil   br    br   I have one more package of this to use and next time Im going to add more veggies and maybe some chopped tomato to cut the heat a bit more  A friend whod been drinking tea for 80 of his 84 years introduced me to this tea a few months ago  Even took me over to the store and bought me a pound  At  7  lb  in a retail store or a little over  9 with shipping from an online merchant  I think its great  Ive been drinking Earl Grey  English Breakfast  Irish Breakfast  Lapsang Souchong  Assam  etc  Most of them were over  30  lb  with shipping  Aside from the Lapsang Souchong  I think this is a great replacement for all the rest  Has everything Im looking for in a strong  fullbodied black tea with enough character to keep it from becoming boring  My current favorite afternoon tea  Unless youre extremely jaded or a tea snob  youll love it  I love strong  full bodied quality tea and typically drink assam  irish breakfast or early grey tea  but as the other reviewer noted the price per pound can be discouraging  So I have been searching for a quality full bodied tea that wasnt bitter at a more palatable price point  and this certainly fits the bill  And unlike some other teas where they tend to be better in one form or another  i  e  iced vs  hot  this tea is excellent in both forms  I would certainly recommend this to anyone who prefers that smooth full bodied quality tea that doesnt cost an arm and leg  I drink this tea plain  without sugar or milk   and it has a pleasant aroma   br    br   The price from Amazon is cheaper than my local grocery store  One reviewer is right  I think it has some herbal smell to make up the aroma  So the label  Imperial Blend  kind of implied the herb   br    br   I am not exactly a black tea drinker  so this tea is a surprise  and affordable too  I usually prefer White Chinese tea  like White Peony  but it is more expensive  and requires lower temperature water  But this is black tea  and this aroma kind of remind me the  softness  of white tea  Ive tried a variety of Ahmad tea  Not because I particularly like this brand  but they are just easier to come across  The Imperial blend  I believe  is the most complex yet well balanced of all the ones Ive tried  Its full body like a good cup of Assam  which by no means overpower the delightful  clean taste of Darjeerling  complete with a long lasting note of bergamot  I enjoy it best in the evening  It gives a satisfying and relaxing finish to a busy day   br    br   For those interested in the specifics  I use about 3 teaspoons of lose tea in a stainless steel infuser in a 16 oz mug  let it steep in 208F water for 23 min  take the infuser out  and drink it without sugar or milk to savor its sophistication  I have tried literally dozens of teas since being introduced to the Russian custom of preparing and drinking tea  and the Ahmad Imperial blend is probably my favorite of all of these due to the fact that it is equally delicious hot or iced  I buy the threepacks as needed from Amazon and go through them rapidly  My family loves it and my friends have it in their homes now too  try one box of it and you will love it too  This is an excellent tea  One of the best I have ever had  It is especially great when you prepare it with a samovar  Herbal additives in this blend destroy real tea taste  It is only for people who like herbal taste  I dont  Makes a tasty  super easy meal  fast  BUT high in calories   br    br   The instructions say to saute the veggies first but I recommend cooking the chicken first  The chicken takes longer to cook and the raw chicken ontop of veggies just makes a slimy mess  I made it with snow peas and carrots only  I dont like the little corn  Added some red pepper flakes for heat and served ontop of rice  It came out wonderful  Dinner on the table in less than 30mins  I think I have tried just about every Bloody Mary mixer on the market at one time or the other  Most have too much sugar or worst  corn syrup  This mixer is all natural ingredients and very tasty  It does have a little kick  Enjoy  Might be a little spicy for some  but this stuff rocks  I use 12 and 12 with V8 for a milder version  or the best is a Bloody Caesar   br   Half mix  half clamato  Took me one or two to get used to the pickle taste  But now aim hooked and have to keep a bottle on hand This candy is not as described  The middle is almost hard it is not a silky or smooth filling as described   br   Looks and tastes like its way past its expiration date   br   Would never reccommend this  Paid a good chunk of cash for nothing I started drinking the power slim tea when I was on the HCG diet to help curb cravings  Since I liked it so well  I tried some of the others and I am now hooked  They are so satisfying that I drink them all the time  The Energy gives you that extra pickmeup in the afternoons that helps keep me going all day  no matter how long  Im trying several of the Wu Yi teas  I like this one particularly because of the subtle citrus taste  It also has a natural sweetness   br    br   The ingredients include Organic WuLi Cliff Oolong Tea  700 mg   Organic Black Tea  600 mg   Organic Green Tea Extract  100 mg   Proprietary blend  600 mg   plus some Ginseng  panax   Orange Peel  Lemon Grass  and Guarana  Other Ingredients  Natual Orange and Citrus flavors   br    br   My goal is to drink more tea and less coffee  I am enjoying trying a different kind of tea every day  Ill be coming back to this one  i cannot live without this citron falksalt  it is wonderful on watermelon  fish  almost any food requiring salt and in my world it all does  just try it on red juicy watermelon  wonderful experience  Terrible  Artificial lemon taste  like Pledge Lemon Furniture Polish  Dont do this to yourself  Just use plain flake salt and some fresh grated lemon zest  These things are huge  I love the way the crystals crunch  and the flavor is not too overpowering or too subtle  This lemony flavor is my favoriteits good on almost everything  Youll have plenty of flavored salt for a long time if you buy this  The taste of these white cheddar flat breads is like a regular cracker  which is not bad  except that I bought them because I wanted a cheese taste   br    br   What was a HUGE disappointment  How misleading the packaging of the box is  The photo on the box  I bought these in store  makes it look like it is full of long flatbreads  expanding the length and width of the box   Wrong  The plastic tray that holds the crackers is about 2  smaller all around  leaving you with about 15 or so small flatbreads   br    br   What is also bad about this is that the company states they use biodegradable and ecofriendly packaging  FAIL  They used a HUGE box for a ridiculously small amount of crackers  Not ecofriendly at all   br    br   Would I buy these again  No  I feel ripped off  The other crackers  like Sesame Tarragon  give you a little  br   more bang for your buck and have more flavor  This is the ultimate puppy food  The kibbles are great for small breeds  High in digestible nutrients as opposed to fillers some companies use  Less waste results from the high quality ingredients  I have been hunting  training  showing and handling various breeds of dogs for nearly 40 years  with multiple National Champions  I have been highly satisfied with Eukanubas quality and the results I have obtained feeding their foods  My recent purchases are with WAG  through AMAZONcom  Their prices are the best I have found and they are very good at shipping immediately on items in stock  The recommendation when we bought our puppies  lhasa  bichon mix and lhasa  poodle mix  was that we continue them on the food that they have had since being weaned  This is a somewhat expensive food so I cant say that we were terribly pleased but we loaded up on the stuff and headed home   br    br   Let me just say this  I have had small dogs before  Never have I seen such gas issues  Both of them consistently had foul gas  Consistently  Usually when theyre sitting on our laps but  you know  Theyre dogs   br    br   When we got through the first bag of this stuff  we purchased more on amazon  It was a great price for it since we got a 40 lb bag for the price of  I think  a 15 lb bag at Petco  But  they continued to have gas  I mean  they loved the food  dont get me wrong and they loved it more when wed mix in some water and it would be like soft food  Somehow that made their gas worse but I think Ill have to give that responsible to the speed with which they chowed down  cant blame the food itself for gluttony   br    br   Eventually  we switched their food  No more farting  I think it was due to the high fat content which undoubtedly is necessary for very small puppies  They just need that in their diet  I think that we were advised to keep them on it for much longer than was useful  they said up until 1 year   Yeah right  you try dealing with gas for that long  Around 6 mos of age we switched to PuppyChow  Much better  Granted  they dont like it as much  but we humans like it a whole lot better  A very delicate green tea with a smooth light taste and an subtle floral tones and no bitter aftertaste   br    br   In the 20  years we have been drinking Ahmad teas not even once have we been disappointed  The superb quality of Ahmad teas has remained consistent throughout the years   br    br   I am so happy to find Ahmad teas available here  thanks Amazon   because only a few stores carry it in my area and they are quite a few miles away  The current deal for the pack of 6 is superb  much cheaper than I can find locally    br    br   This is a great tasting tea  which I am happy to recommend  Fresh  a great way to get a little chocolate in my life without a million calories  They taste just like chocolate pudding  If you like the Ceylon tea variety  you will certainly enjoy and appreciate this tea   br    br   I am so happy to find Ahmad teas available here  thanks Amazon   and very surprised at the negative review from 2009 because in the 20  years we have been drinking Ahmad teas not even once have we been disappointed  The superb quality of Ahmad teas has remained consistent throughout the years   br    br   The current deal for the pack of 4 is very good  cheaper than I can find locally    br    br   Highly recommended   br    br   NOTE  This listings description is confusing  Each packet of tea weighs 500 grams  which equals 11 pounds or 176 ounces  Ive been enjoying this tea for years  This tea is good mornings  afternoons or evenings  My local store went out of buisiness  Thanks Amazon  I use a bodum tea press to prepare a pot  Hi  I have to have black tea everyday  I have done it in the past 25 years and its a habit of mine  Ahmad tea is one of my favorite brands and I highly recommend it if you like black tea  I think this is going to remain my favorite for the next 100 years or so  I have tried it out despite the other review and I found that this is exactly the same tea i buy in either Russian or Italian groceries  Ahmad Tea is an excellent looseleaf tea eith hot or for making iced tea  Great flavor with no lingering aftertaste  Ive been drinking this tea for the past 8 or 10 years  usually buying a box or two when visiting large metropolitan areas  where many MiddleEastern stores carry loose Ahmad teas  usually at  57 for a pound box  Ive always considered it an unremarkable but robust tea  with enough aroma and taste  and beautiful reddish color  perhaps not good enough a tea to drink on its own  but a decent base for mixes   br   This tea  however  is nothing of the sort  Freshly opened package has almost no characteristic tea smell  and the brewed tea is weak  flat and tasteless  Somehow it just does not seem to be the same product anymore  So  you get a lot of tea for the money  but the quality is such that you might as well drink Lipton bags  they are not that much worse  I love love love this deal  its way fun to pick from so many  Teas and chocolates and ciders as well as many coffees  The other outfits that assemble samplers are boring  they do the choosing  and from a much narrower range  The sellers here are very nice  also  and will answer questions via email about the slightly confusing ordering method  its easy   If you want great packaging  forget it  they ship fast  and the kups are just tossed loose in a box  Who cares  Once youve tried some random sampler packs  and now are overloaded with decafs  extra bolds  or teas   this is a great way to get exactly the brands or style that you want  Received the order in a couple of days and was exactly what I ordered  This was my second order and Ill be ordering this item again  good products and fast shipping equals a happy me  a little pricey but you can hand pick a few good flavors  a few i cant find anywhere else so def worth the price If used on a daily basis you will keep your gums healty and between your teeth clean and free of plack  WOW  This product is very impressive  I bought the 8oz blueberry and was pleased with packaging  price and shipping  The powder dissolves instantly  Even in water  Ive just been mixing a 14 tsp in a small glass of water for now and drinking it down and it tastes great   but will add it to my smoothies and juiced fruit juices next  This product is so economical compared to purchasing fresh blueberries  especially because there is no waste due to mold or overripe berries thrown away  I think you could add this to baked or unbaked foods as well  Im excited to add more of the SuperFoods to my diet in this fast and easy way  I definitely will being trying the other flavors soon  The pork chops from Omaha Steaks were very tasty but at the same time exceptionally dry  Pork is usually dry meat but these were to the extreme  Possibly shipping them frozen and keeping them frozen was partly the problem  Five minutes in  one tentacle was bitten off  ball inside cracked in half  Not durable enough to be a dog toy  Disappointed   So is the dog   I am chemical sensitive as well as sugarfree  I have been using this product for over a year  I use it maybe once a week at the most  I drink 12 the bottle and then boost my energy after an hour or two depending on how I feel  IMO this doesnt replace my a  m  coffee but is sweet in the early afternoon when I start to fade  Once in a while I drink a full bottle before a workout  Ive been drinking Guayaki Yerba Mate teas for years  Compared to the many toxic energy boosters out there I highly recommend this  This product is clean and doesnt leave nasty chems behind in the body  Try it before you judge from a review  everyones body reacts differently  I felt energized within five minutes  but it lasted for about 45 minutes  I paid  399 for this drink  I could have just drunk a cup of coffee and saved my money  Yes  its probably healthier than 5  Hour Energy or Starbucks shots but if youre looking to avoid a caffeine overload  this is still not for you  Most energy drinks cannot be made w  out a high dosage of caffeine  I believe the caffeine content of 1 Guayaki shot is 150 mL  probably lower than other unhealthy energy shot drinks but I believe most other people avoid the top brands b  c they contain too much caffeine and  or sugar  If you do not react well to caffeine  Guayaki is not a good buy either  I definitely feel an energy boost w  1 full Guayaki shot but not w  out all the other caffeine side effects  irritability  nervousness  moodswings  Caffeine overdose is why I stopped drinking coffee  But it looks even organic energy drinks are still not safe   br    br   Now youre NOT sensitive to caffeine  then its a great buy  Its not loaded w  sugar  The taste is easy and pleasant  Its not loaded w  a bunch of chemicals like 5  Hour shots or Starbucks drinks  And the energy boost lasts for about 4 to 5 hours  Takes about 5 to 7 minutes to kick in but all this probably depends on your body  weight   br    br   Side note  if you want to feel energized during the day  have a protein drink first thing in the morning and stay away for heavy  fattening foods during the day that will make you feel sluggish and sleepy  These Nature Valley Nut Lovers Variety Pack was perfect  Although I wasnt sure about the peanut butter bar  it was excellent  I loved the Roasted Almond  Roasted Pecan and the Peanut Butter   br    br   I will definately buy from this seller again  Quick shipping and very fresh  I so wish I would have read this review before purchasing TWO gallons of this oil for my health issues  It reeks like a chemical rubber smell  This smell is coming from the black rubber gasket in the lid  When I called to report the situation to the company  Sabrina told me I would have to pay to send them a sample to have tested by a lab  Unbelievable  Good customer service would indicate that they would pay for the product to be returned and give me a full refund  including shipping  The product is faulty  Period  I will never order anything from this company again and do not recommend it to anyone based on this horrible customer service and lack of responsibility and ownership  This product has a strong aftertaste of Crayola crayons   br    br   I am in the process of trying different brands of coconut oils for cooking purposes  Upon opening the plastic container  the aroma of crayons immediately fills the room  and this flavor permeates the food that is cooked in it   br    br   I suspect the source of the problem is the plastic used in the plastic container as I have not experienced this with any of the other brands purchased   br    br   To date  my favorite coconut oil is distributed by Barleans  The flavor is fantastic  However  they do not supply a gallonsized tub  and Dr  Mercola has the best product in that size category  Had this shipped to my sister who follows a glutenfree eating plan and she reports that it is very versatile and easier than grinding almonds for a crispy crust on chicken and fish filets  Also uses it in place of bread crumbs in meatloaf and meatballs  Stays moist when added in place of wheat flour in baking  too  Good product  good value  These are healthy and my mixed Llasa  Tibetan Terrier adores them  And they are healthy and his breath doesnt smell and his teeth are in good shape because of such products  A great healthy product  A great healthy chew for my 9 wk old beagle  Rio  He loves the taste and it sure beats my arm  I really enjoy this product  I had such a hard time finding it affordable in the store  Once I found it I look no further  its the only sugar I use  Thanks so much  I have used and liked Sugar in the Raw for many years  after being introduced to it in a Starbucks  My most recent purchase  however  was disappointing  The sugar was lighter in color and had a crystal size maybe 14 th of the regular size  Having large crystals was something I always really liked about Sugar in the Raw  It enhanced the quality of mixed drinks and of lattes  I called their hotline to complain and was told that they had had a problem with their recent sugar crop and that the result was less molasses in the sugar  They have had many complaints of a similar nature  This  they claimed  also reduced the crystal size  They said this problem should go away with their newer crop  The representative said that the newcrop sugar will have a 610 digit date code  without ANY spaces  that ends with a  1  and no letters  The trailing digits are a date code using the Julian calendar   My recent badpurchase had a space after the initial sequence of numbers and then ended with a  51A    Bottom line  their current product is not much better than much cheaper products  When they get a better crop  Ill go back to purchasing Sugar in the Raw   Sugar in the Raw   tm  Please Harvest Cane w  o Burning  br   To be delivered to  HC  S  br   Dear  Sugar in the Raw  folks   br    br   We who buy your product care about the environment  And wed like to know that you care too  When you burn the cane fields on Maui  it adds to the CO2 and worsens climate change  And the smoke from your burning is damaging the lungs of your workers  your workers  children and the residents of Maui   br    br   We love your product and want you to change to noburn harvesting so we can continue to buy it  knowing we arent contributing to Global Warming and lung disease   br    br      Love this sugar  I also get muscavado sugar and they are both great to use in place of regular white sugar  Recommend  Product is exactly as advertised  What a savings  At least half the retail price  Easy to store because of the individual packaging  I used to buy this sugar for years  I do not eat much sugar  but still  This sugar is called turbinado sugar  but is misleading  I picked this brand just because it says real turbinado sugar  and other brands  in the local food store  that their sugar is brown because it is colored with caramel or something   br    br   HOW did i find out  I needed just a sweet water few days ago  I put this Sugar in The Raw in the glass  The water became brown and on the bottom of the glass i got just PURE WHITE SUGAR CRYSTALS    What a shame on the producer  U can try to put this sugar in your mouth and after few seconds you will spit out pure white crystals as well   br    br   Im just wondering if the consumers can hold the company liable for such a practice  Its just sugar in the raw  its flavor profile is much better then white sugar and its suppose to be better for you or something  I just wish the bags were resealable  This is a delicious sugar  It has a pretty light brown color and delicious aroma  But the granules are quite big  however   bigger than plain refined sugar  This makes is difficult to cream butter and sugar together  But if you use it in a recipe where you will melt the sugar first before baking it  or if you use it to brew beer and plan to boil it to melt it  it is a great product  It would be the perfect sugar if only the granules were a bit finer  I only use raw sugar  it did seem a little smaller than the normal crystals but it is still good  Will buy again  This sugar is very good  Use this in your coffee  cereal  etc for a week and youll never go back to white sugar  white sugar will taste terrible  Plus from what Ive read  this Raw sugar contains a lot of minerals that are missing in our diets   br    br   The product was delivered fast and wellpackaged  My only complaint is the price  I wish I could find Raw sugar cheaper  I would be happy to buy in bulk  but this is the cheapest I have found  I thought this was a great buy  but as noted by Scott D   the molasses content was not up to par  I loved the higher molasses content  Sugar in the Raw   Unfortunately what I purchased recently does not have the higher molasses content and I have twelve 24 ounce bags  I guess Ill watch for the next crop  I really love this sugar and pricewise its much cheaper to buy it here on amazon compared to anywhere else  Love this sugar  It tastes so much better and isnt as overly sweet tasting as  regular  sugar  Weve used it in quite a few baking items and they always turn out very good  The price that Amazon has this set at is very good to and makes it easy to use this for everyday stuff  Cant say anything bad about Sugar in the Raw  I like it better than the other  natural  sugars  Better consistency and  I know it doesnt matter  but better color  Unfortunately  one of the  natural  paper bags got torn a bit in the box  It didnt look like the box was damaged so I cant tell how it happened  but it was sort of pain to clean up half a bag that spilled all over the inside of the box and our kitchen when I opened it  Not sure what the solution is and Id order it again  but if it happens again  Id switch to one of the brands that ship in an unnatural plastic bag  Great service  Items arrived faster than expected  Very efficient  Will use this seller again  I highly recommend this seller  Thank you for the excellent service  Please ignore the onestar comments  if you check the bag the main ingredient IS in fact whole grain brown rice and the second is rice flower  With anything that is gluten free you have to add another  binder  which is where the corn flour comes in  For someone who has celiac disease and cannot have Sunchips  because they contain wheat  a key binder to any chip  cookie or cereal  this is an excellent product  My spouse and I buy these a lot because they are gluten free and absolutely delicious  Best flavor ever  Im addicted  They are all good but these are by far the best  I could live on these  And there is no need for anymore to say  So many  healthy  products dont taste very good  Or taste good when you first try them and then go downhill  Ive had these chips on more than one occasion and they are very tasty  Ive served them to guests twice and both times they wanted to know what they were and where to get them  Its also nice to have something glutenfree for friends who are borderline diabetic  but I would eat them anyway  I found these crisps at our local WalMart  figured I would give them a try  They were so yummy I may never go back to regular chips  not that I was a big chip fan anyway  The only problem is I can eat the entire bag in one sitting  I give these crisps a big thumbs up  This is one of the best tasting crisps I have ever eaten  I only buy it on special occassions because I know Ill eat the whole bag  I paid  179 for a 2 ounce pkg of these at lunch today  I bought them because brown rice is a  good  carb  As soon as I tasted one and it tasted like a corn chip I checked the ingredients  The name is deceptive  these have  Masa corn flour  listed in the ingredients and it overwhelms the taste  I wont buy these again  I can get Sunchips for less money and similar taste  I use the Rotel Mild and I LOVE this product so muchit saves me on a daily basis  If youre trying to cook lower fat  healthier foods and in a HURRY  this stuff makes it so much easier  Ever notice that some canned tomatos have a weird  tin can  taste when you make spagehetti sauce or whatever  For some reason this product doesnt have that  It tastes so good you can just dump it in with a can of beans  heat and eat   br    br   or add some chili powder and now you have chili soup  I also make indian dishes with this  and spicey spaghetti sauce  I also prefer this to most canned salsas  so it works for things like quesadillas if you drain the liquid off   br    br   None of my local grocery stores carry it at all  nor do they carry anything like it  So I have to pay Amazons inflated price to order this by the case  I dont like that Im paying a higher price  but I LOVE LOVE LOVE the product  the price on this product certainly raises my attention on compairing amazon price with the local stores  i can get a can of this rotel at my local kroger for  1  dissapointing  howdy yall   br    br   the actual product is VERY good  id rate the item a 4 on its own  however  its only ONE dollar at the local grocery and   twenty eight  dollars per twelve pack  these are running almost two and a half dollars each   br    br   as i said  TOO EXPENSIVE    sigh    i was really hoping to get them at something approaching the local cost   br    br   take care   br   lee Nothing wrong with the product  but I sure had to mix it with  lots  of other ingredients to make it edible to me   In Texas I was called a  babymouth   not into very spicyhot foods    br    br   For comparison  Im comfortable with Tostitos medium chunky salsa  1 can of this milder Rotel  mixed with 2 slightly larger cans of diced tomatoes  was still way too hot for me to use as salsa for chips  I used some of this to make a sort of southwestern cornbread that was good though  This is a fantastic product  and I wish it was readily available in most stores  Its taste is not the greatest  but its a 25 oz  shot  and its gone in a second  It tastes  more or less  like a concentrated sweet tea  For the record  Ive had 5 hour energy  and that tastes FAR worse  I will put up the taste for the results  Its got 150mg of caffeine  which is the equivalent of the big red bulls and monsters  I cant stand sucralose and sugar substitutes  and this is one of the only shot sized energy drinks that has only sugar in it  The sugar is at 9g  which isnt horrible  I used to drink 4 16oz  Red Bulls a day for the caffeine  and this gives me far better energy  and is much more subtle  My preference is black coffee  but I cant drink 812 cups a day anymore  Overall  Steaz does it right  real organic ingredients in moderate amounts  and they create big results  I have to get up really early to work out before work and I get super tired by the middle of the afternoon  I was drinking one 5 hour energy  usually extra strength  each day  It worked well  but gave me a jittery feeling  almost headachy but not quite  My husband got me to try this and I was skeptical  but for me it works as well if not better than the 5 hour energy and doesnt give me that jittery almostheadache feeling   br    br   I dont mind the tasteit reminds me of the inside of a fig newton  mmm   And the price is ok  on Amazon anyway  At my grocery store they were almost  3 each  yike   br    br   And its organicso I can feel good about it  right  Its all about me feeling good  I bought these for my husband and he said they are the best energy shots out there  He takes one in the mornings and works hard all day  Good stuff  I am a energy junkie and Im not sure if this works or not  but what I do know is that the taste is not the greatest  I do drink the steaz energy drink and I think I get the same results  I like this products because it is more natural then the others  If you want an organic energy shot  your choices are this one from Steaz and the assorted flavors from Guayaki  Guayaki Yerba Mate is actually in the Steaz energy shot and energy drinks  and they both use Sambazon Acai  so there are some similarities in ingredients   br    br   Great energy burst for 4  hours on a Steaz Energy Shot  and no withdrawals or headaches afterwards  Plan on drinking one every day at lunch at work  This will help me cut down on my iced coffees  which are not helping my calorie intake   br    br   Already ordering 12  packs on subscribe and save  2 per month  Great value  I was looking for a natural energy shot that works  and I found it  Steaz energy shot is my favorite   br    br   I recently had gastric bypass surgery  so tons of sugar is a nono  And Im also allergic to Sucralose  Splenda  so most other energy drinks are out   br    br   I tried Bazi energy shots and they didnt work as well as Steaz  and definitely didnt taste as well  These have a taste thats almost like CocaColanot bad at all   br    br   If youre looking for natural energy  give these a try  I had tried both of the Guayaki energy shots and I dont like the taste of either of them  This one has more natural caffeine and tastes much better  I like them cold for sure  My husband and I take these on road trips in a little cooler with ice and waters and we dont have to make stops for coffee  Especially on the turnpikes where its just way too expensive  Its worth the     per shot  We normally split them  Im really sensitive to caffeine  even the natural kind so I get a little weird if I drink the whole thing but thats the same for coffee too for me  My husband drinks the whole shot and gets a nice wake up boost  I would recommend these over any of the sinthetic shots out there  You can feel good about putting this in your body  Ill be ordering again soon for sure  I purchased it because it was on sale  In terms of the energy it provides  it works  but the taste leaves something to be desired  I tried mixing it with some water to make it more drinkable  Ive been feeling extremely tired around the late afternoon  As a software engineer  this is entirely unacceptable  So  I asked the nice lady at the counter of my local Whole Foods Market  for something that will give me that extra energy I need to get through the day   br    br   She excitedly returned with a suspicious little green bottle  Over three hours after drinking whatever that was  my brain is still working at unnatural speeds  To summarize my experiences  I believe this works   br    br   She did explain that I needed to drink plenty of water with it  which I personally feel helped the energy level  So if youre feeling tired during the day and hate coffee  give this a shot  preferably before you eat anything   br    br   Woot  The energy shot truly does work  It had a terrible aftertaste at first  but now that I know what to expect  I am getting used to it  I always have some water handy as a chaser  which helps  I am so glad to have found something that gives me the energy I need without all the chemicals found in other beverages  Its helped me kick my addiction to Diet Coke and other aspartamelaced caffeinated beverages  Yay    Ive tried 5  hour energy  red rain  NOS  and other energy shots  This is my favorite in terms of taste and effect  Plus  its somewhat reassuring to know that natural ingredients are used  Sometimes I wonder what Im really putting into my body with some of the other brands  I purchase a box about once every 2 months for the past 2 years  If youre looking for an energy boost without artificial sweeteners and other chemicals  this is a great option  The taste is decent and it is a nice smooth uplift without jitters  I first found Steaz Berry Energy Shots at a local organic market  I bought two bottles  which cost just under three dollars each  I fell in love instantly  The drink is delicious   I can taste the yerba mate and the acai juice  like a slightly bitter fruity chocolate honey tea  I am very sensitive to sucralose  Splenda  which is in so many energy drinks these days  I also hate the taste  I love that Steaz has actual sugar and no artificial sweeteners  The rush it gives me is slow and even  I have several medical conditions  including fibromyalgia  which saps me of energy and causes intense pain  I like how Steaz helps clear away the fatigue and fog so I can get things done  No caffeine jitters  even though there are 150 mg of caffeine in each bottle   br   It was becoming expensive for me to buy the bottles separately at stores  so I started looking online for a bulk price  I am so thrilled to have found the Pack Of 12 on Amazon  I signed up for Amazon Prime specifically for this product  hah  I have tried other energy shots and this one is the only one that really makes me feel good and energized without any other sides effects at all  its also the best taste  others taste like medicine  this one has a tea fresh taste  I love it  I drive OTR  Over the Road truck and this helps to keep me alert  It has no sugar high  no crash  Im on a autoship which i like  The price is very good  Ive seen it over 2 bucks in the store  Products takes pretty good  and it doesnt leave you gittery  With subscibe and save as well as Prime membership I pay below  2 a shot  My wife tried them and now she drinks them like they are going out of style  I moderate mine and they make for more effective use before weight training  I recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a healthier alternative to high sugar and unnatural products that are everywhere that still gives you the results of an AWESOME Energy Drink  I use this product daily  and it provides a steady stream of energy  I do not get jittery or crash  It also helps me practice portion control because it acts as a slight appetite suppressant  Ive been buying and drinking this for over a year now  and the energy boost is excellent  with a continuous   6  hour effect  The most recent shipments seem to have improved the flavor slightly as well  or perhaps Im getting more used to it  I dont drink it for the flavor  but its not as heinous as the fake flavors found in the other  nonorganic energy shots  This is the first time Ive really been misled by other reviews on amazon  I like 5  hr Energy  I find Rain ok and so I thought Id try this product based on the reviews  Boy am I sorry  I gagged getting one bottle down even with my nose pinched  really   And it leaves the worst medicinal taste in your mouth afterwards  8 tic tacs at once did not get rid of it  But worst of all  within an hour I was yawning and drowsy  Unless you really like things that taste of a weird teaflavored cough syrup and dont work  dont buy this  I dont know what to do with the other 11 bottles  big fail I loved this mold  I wished I could have used it for more than one occasion  but it didnt last  I did use it to make 30  suckers for my daughters first birthday  But there was going to be no way that the mold could be salvaged after that  I would have liked to have kept to use on other occasions  but for the price it didnt matter to me that much  It served its main purpose  You HAVE to try the VANILLA Tootsie Rolls  The regular chocolate ones are good  but THESE are the BEST EVER   Try this you might like it  I did and I am quite addicted  it is too easy to prepare  it tastes great and it absorbs the flavors you cook it with  The price is really good and well worth the purchase  If you like this type of Couscous like I do  then give this one a tryIt can be eaten hot  room temp or in a cold salad with a variety of greens and other flavors  it takes on the other flavors very well when mixed  I cooked the Couscous with a broth and oilive oil for added flavor and it rocked my taste buds big time  I will be back for more  This tricolor couscous is really good  full of flavor and fun to eat  I love the texture  I cook in chicken broth and add some minced garlic and chopped herbs  parsley  cilantro   along with some red pepper flakes  At the end of cooking  I add some olive oil and this makes a wonderful side dish  Highly recommend I tried to find israeli couscous in a number of upsacale grocery stores and no luck  So I decided to try good ole Amazoncom and selected this product  It is so good  add a few herbs and its a great side dish  or add more and make a  pasta type  saladso very good  I am hooked  Great flavor and so easy to prepare  The package came with the label torn off and no cooking instructions  I know how I normally cook Couscous so tried 34 cup water to 1 cup couscousbrought to a boil and let sit  covered for 5min  It was mushy and tastelessWe have thrown out the rest of the container  I wouldnt even think of buying this product unless I know the price per unit  How can I compare other items online or in a store  I love ordering whole bean coffee on Amazon  I like this so much that this my first product review  I have to say that Im usually not a big fan of flavored coffee  but I thought I would give it a try  When my husband started grinding it up  I could smell it throughout the house  Sometimes with flavored coffees  the smell is there but the taste isnt  However  not with this one  Im now going to order another flavor from this company and will give it a try  I love this coffee  I do wish it came already ground as I dont have a grinder and use a blender instead  But its worth it  Many flavored coffees Ive tried only seem to have a flavored odor that doesnt reach the coffee  but this one manages both  This brand of coffee has been available in my local stores for some time   Ive believe the company is local  Ive been drinking it for quite some time and have not tired of it  Im particularly fond of the Turtle Sundae but all the flavors are good  I cant say that Ive had a bad one   br    br   As it turns out  its less expensive to order it from Amazon and have it show up at my front door than it is for me to run out to the local Walmart to get it  Its a no brainer  Try it  if you like rich  flavored coffee  youll like it  It is hot  I love it  tasty and a little sweet  I usually scoff at salsas labeled as hot  but this one lives up to its billing  I consume about a jar every two weeks of this  either adding it to fajitas or using it as a corn chip dip  It is hot  but after awhile the medium Salsa Suprema was too mild for me  I thought maybe Id cut down how much I ate by going to the hot Salsa Ranchera  Its hot enough that people who arent used to it will say  Thats hot     br    br   Flavor  bright and forward  The similarly hot Salsa Victoria is a duller taste to me  I guess earthy  This salsa is much brighter in the mouth  I dont like to go hotter than this because the sauces Ive tried lose any resemblance to yummy salsa and just taste hot  this happens to me with Tabasco sauce  for example    br    br   A drawback is La Victoria doesnt make a larger bottle of Salsa Ranchera nor Salsa Victoria  nor do they sell them in    or Sams Club  To get a good deal you have to watch for sales  service was great  but I meant to buy Swiss Chalet chicken SAUCE not the Marinade   br    br   Love the sauce  have yet to try the marinade Use frequently as we like to do Asian dishes at least once a week  Love this product  Fast shipping  as usual  Would buy again  These individually wrapped pieces are delicious  although I wish there were a few more   Mildly sweet with no sugarfree aftertaste  even a traditional  marzipanaholic  should enjoy these  Put this in my husbands stocking for Christmas and it was a hit  I was amazed at how quickly it arrived  It is a cute stocking stuffer  but only OK as far as user appeal  You get what you pay for  Toy was typical quality I expected  I got taken for a major ride on the shipping  So we cancelled the order  It was cancelled without any problem  That is a positive note  i love the convenience of the singles  The best creamer aroundTaste is just like the big bottle  I can stick them in my purse and take them to work  These creamers come in 4 packs of 25  I have taken one to work and opened one for home so far  and havent found a single broken or leaking creamer yet  I usually have way too much cream and sugar in my coffee  but with these it is easy for me to cut down on the sweetness because I wont allow myself more than 2 creamers per cup  I think this is definitely the best option for buying creamers from Amazon since all the other listings have a lot of complaints about creamers breaking in shipping  Even though we are International Delight fans we were not completely dissapointed by this product  We had no problem with the shipment  but the creamer itself is thinner than International Delight  Other than that we are happy D Besides the obvious convenience and portability of the individual creamers  I liked this item specifically because of packaging  I couldnt believe how many reviews I read about coffee creamer cups  but many of the Amazon creamer options  both Coffeemate and International Delight  had multiple negative reviews due to the shipment arriving with broken cups thanks to sloppy packaging   br    br   That was not an issue here  The shipment arrived in four dispensing boxes of 50 each  as shown in the photo  those boxes were tightly packed in a thick cardboard box which could take a good beating before damaging the inner boxes  Thus  none of my cups were broken  no waste and no sloppy drippy mess  Plus the four boxes means I could put one in the kitchen  one in the bathroom  we moved our mini Keurig there when we upgraded the kitchen Keurig  best idea my husband ever had   and one at work  with a reserve for whichever runs out first   br    br   If you are looking for these mini creamers but deterred like I was by the negative packaging reviews on other options  this is your best bet  As a bonus  the auto delivery price is very reasonable  This seller is very nice  And the price is very good  The only reason I stop ording is bacause I went to sugar free  and at that time he did not have it  But for those of you that dont have to watch there fat in take  I would get this product from them  I purchased these coffee mate singles to use at work along with the coffee  tea  bags  Theyre great because they dont require refrigeration  I received the items in a timely manner  Upon receipt  I removed a pack to consume  The poptart was STALE and left an awful taste in my mouth  I found these new spring PopTarts and bought them on a whim  My kids and I were amazed and delighted at the fun  colorful  amazingly detailed artwork on these PopTarts  Fantastic for after school snacks  lunch boxes  and school treats  Tie with a ribbon for a bright  thinking of you this spring  gift  The only challenge is finding more in stores  Way to go Kelloggs  fantastic product  Yes  I am having a cup right now  I went all over town looking for this coffee after been invited to a non profit organization to a banquet and besides the delicious food they top it off with this amazing delicious coffee  I paid and extra 20 bucks to get it right way and it is worth the money  Highly recommend  Taste like it is stale  Will not order this again  I had this coffee at a 50th year annerversery at a reception hall and had to have it  This stuff tasted NOTHING  like the Douwe Egberts at the hall  This is possibly stale coffee  Serveice delivery with the seller was excellent  The product was not  Will not order again  Bad taste  Iam not sure if it was old or that how it tastes  I throw it right away  i coudl not drink it  This is honestly THE BEST seasoning salt in all the land  It tightens up any dish  not spicy  just perfectly seasoned  Its perfect  hence  my purchase of this 35 oz  mamma jamma  The order arrived as advertised  I have had only a few chances to use it  but it is awesome  The flavor is exactly what I hoped for  It may take me a while to finish the entire gallon  but I will definnantly order again  I like a lot of sesame oil and use it in salads regularly  Great quality  flavor and aroma  Cant beat that its organic  Bought a set of two when my son was about 6 months  and we started taking them with us whenever we went out to eat  I cut up cantaloupe  apple  banana  even used sweet potatoes a few times    just whatever I could get at the restaurant   and it would keep my son busy long enough that I could actually eat  Its great because I didnt have to be overly worried about him choking on big chunks  and he got to try out new foods  I wouldnt hesitate to buy this again  I have a slightly different version of this  different brand  My son started using it around six months  and he really enjoys it  He DOES get messy if he eats something sticky or juicy like banana or watermelon  but whatever  Anyway  I also had trouble cleaning it  until I tried scrubbing it with a nail or vegetable brush  That works pretty well  It takes some time  but not as much as it would take to run food through a food mill or blender  or cut it up  then clean it up off him  the chair  the floor  the dog  me  well you get the picture  What a GREAT idea    My daughter love it   br   I dont think is difficult to wash  I mean  is not like just toss water and thats it  but  come on     br   Absolutely recommend it  This product is impossible to wash and actually get cleaned  I couldnt get the food pieces out to save my life  I tried scrubbing them out and even washed it in the dishwasher as it suggests  I loved this product for fruits and other food that I didnt want my new baby to choke on  I also used it to put ice in when my baby was teething  It worked great for this  as well as for the food  I didnt like bananas in it thoughimpossible to get clean  I love  love  love the idea of this product and my little one loves  loves  loves to use it  She gets fresh fruit and other tasty things and I dont have to worry about her choking  The only drawback is that bits of food get stuck in the mesh and the seams and are impossible to get out  Granted  some foods are more difficult than others and some dont cause that much of a problem  Bananas however  have pretty much destroyed a couple of them  While I love this product  I think that next time I will get the one that has the removable and replaceable mesh bags  The Munchkin fresh food feeder is an okay product  its kind of like sucking on food through a cloth  While my daughter was interested in it for a little while  she eventually lost interest  I may introduce it back to her again and see how she reacts  This product is amazing  I know a few people with little ones that use these and they LOVE them   Super easy to clean and use  When ordering these  I was under the impression that there were 2 per package  FYItheyre not   Only one per  I ordered these for my coffee themed wedding  When they arrived I had to fight off friends because they smelled and tasted so good  I literally had to hide the box to the wedding  They were a big hit on my wedding day and there were none left over that we put on the tables  It was a great tasting product for the lowest price Ive seen   These are delicious  The chocolate is excellent and the espresso bean was the perfect roast for this purpose  Crunchy and not bitter    a href      Chocolate Covered Espresso Beans 5 Pounds a The product was exactly as advertised and fresh  Unfortunately  I keep them in a candy dish in the office and they are going fast  We need to reorder to keep up with  demand  These chocolate covered espresso beans are wonderful  The chocolate is very dark and rich and the  bean  inside is a very delightful blend of flavors with just enough caffine to really give it a zing  Popchips are so good  I have been following Weight Watchers and lost 50 pounds and am at my goal  These Popchips are my salty crunchy indulgence  They taste so good  Ive purchased dozens of bags of this pancake mix  which is a great product  by the way   This is the highest price Ive seen  Whole Foods carries this item and its been on sale there for  999  thats Canadian dollars  too  as Im in Canada   Its even cheaper on Bakers Boxs own website  and theyre the company selling this product through Amazon  For a twopack they should be charging  20 or less  What gives  I thought Amazon was where you could find competitive prices  The Sugar was sweet  that can not be denied  As advertised  It didnt melt when baked either  However  it will not do for your Liege Waffles  Gaufres what the larger pebbles of Belgian pearl will do  These grains are smaller  think pretzel salt  or seed pearls  Thats exactly what I was looking for to bake some chouquettes  puffs with small sugar pearls on top   Works great  yum   This is what I was looking for and was missing it  The taste is exactly the taste as the one made in India so just loved it and remember my days back in India  Definitely recommend it  I bought this strawberry extract hoping to spruce up a strawberry wine that ended up with less flavor than Id original expected   A common problem in some fruit wines    br    br   This is  indeed  good strawberry flavor  Just add to your sugary concoction  be it a baking good  a dessert or a drink  to either give strawberry flavor  or add to existing flavor   and presto  just about everyone will be licking their lips  and maybe fingers    br    br   For those interested  I found the right addition to a liquid volume to be 4 oz of extract per 1 gallon of liquid  Great stuff and dependable  especially when there are a million brands  out there  to choose from  I love the stuff  For really high end desires  I go with the Apollo Olive Oils from California  But I buy a whole lot more of this stuff and will buy it again and again  I hadnt tried  or heard of  till recently Weavers not its my favorite  I am running through the list of types they have looking for a favorite and havent found one yet  theyre all so darned smooth  No bite  no after taste  a little pricy but still worth it  No worse price wise than starbucks or peets  Will keep running through the list here and see what happens  Love them all so far  Having always been a strict Peets Coffee lover  I was reticent to switch brands but Weavers won my heart   The taste is clean and strong  the ethos is correct  organic  baby  and even the packaging is very zen and appropriate  Be still my caffeinated heart  Go ahead and drink the other brands served at your neighborhood cafe if you must but make sure you have a stash of Weavers Peru Organic Whole Bean at home to serve up to your friends and family who deserve the best coffee  And when you go back to that corner cafe where people drink average coffee because they dont know better  take along a travel mug filled with Weavers coffee from home and enjoy a real Cup of Joe  Er  Weavers  A very bitter tasting coffee even when enhanced with cream and  or honey  Definately not my cup of coffee  Oh  did i say it was bitter  Im learning that Latin American and South American coffees have this distinct  coffee  caramelish finish  As a Peets Coffee fanatics we learned that Weavers roaster was the roaster for Peets and we are hooked  I already reviewd the French and Organic blend  but I must say this coffee here is a perfect afternoon drink   br   Met the weavers team at the Warner Brothers party and they gave me a half a pound of french roast  Since them we are fans   br   You wont be dissapointed  I like eating these whenever I need an energy boost   br   It has everything that I am searching for in a   To Go Snack    br   Fiber plus Chocolate is never a bad thing    These are my favorite bars ever  The combo of raisons and dark choc is wonderful  Very filling  These are hard to find in the stores  Im thankful for subsrcibe and save  My fiance loves these dark chocolate and nut granola bars and all the grocery stores around us dont carry them anymore  Once again  Amazon came through and he couldnt be happier  I was buying Quaker Oats granola bars but these Nature Valley chewy bars are better tasting  they make a great snack when Im on the go  Chocolate  peanuts and raisins  it doesnt get any better  Hard to get husband to eat breakfast before school  He takes two bars now and is very happy to do so  It is often hard to find flavor in local grocery stores  So again  Amazoncom came through with a reasonable price  Now  I came keep the husbands breakfast ready as he runs out the door in the mornings  I often like to have a bar in the evening as a night snack   Nantucket Blend coffee is one of my favorites  I was suprised that it was a single box  every time I ordered before it was a 2 pack  My fault for not reading closer  I will not order any more at this price for 1  24 count  Green Mountain  Nantucket Blend  KCups make a very good cup of coffee in my  a

 br    br   CFH When we received our Keurig Elite for Christmas  we were so excited to break open the sample pack of pods to try out different blends and flavors  Of the 12 pods we had in the box  four were Green Mountain Coffee brand  Id never tried anything from this company before  but from what I had researched online  they have the largest range of Keurig pods and have even bought out competitors to produce coffee under their brand names as well   br    br   Unfortunately  I was immediately disappointed by the quality of the coffee  We tried their Dark Magic  Decaf and Breakfast Blend and all were underwhelming  to say the least  I was almost completely set on writing off Green Mountain altogther   br    br   We had one GM pod left and being of the mindset of wastenotwantnot  I figured Id give it one last go around before forgetting about them completely  And Im glad I did   br    br   The Nantucket Blend is a perfectly pleasing cup of coffee  It is nice and flavorful without being thick and pungent  unlike some of the other GM blends we tried   I added some flavored creamer to it and it almost measures up to our goto Caribou Blend pods  Almost  All in all  this is a very standard cup of coffee which  while it isnt anything new or exciting  is very pleasing and definitely one of the better Keurig options weve been able to test out  When we run out of all the pods weve accumulated  Ill probably pick up a box of these as well   br    br   Now that I know Green Mountain isnt completely disappointing Ill definitely be open to trying a few more of their coffees  with our promotion for getting the bewer we ordered  a href      Green Mountain Coffee Golden French Toast  KCup Portion Pack for Keurig KCup Brewers  24  Count a to try as well  and see how it goes from there   br    br   If youre looking for a goto choice  this is your cup  Green Mountain is my favorite brand  Nantucket is my favorite coffee from Green Mountain  Very smooth flavor  Not too strong and not too weak  I was looking for a replacement for Timothys Kona Blend which is no longer carried on Amazon  This coffee from Green Mountain is very nice  but not strong enough for me  If you like milder coffees  then this one is for you  One of Green Mountains best blends of coffee in my opinion  love it for your everyday blend  perfect stregnth  excellent blend  This is just Fantastic Chicken Noodle soup  the best I have ever eaten  with large hearty chunks of chicken  and vegetables and nice large noodles  This soup is just so full bodied  and is seasoned just right  I am so glad Amazon carries this product  I just cant find it here in Vermont  I have used this oil for several years and it is the best for eating with bread or cooking  I love the regular  I use it on everything  You wont be sorry you tired it  great for dipping bread and cooking omelet  and green beans  Oh my gosh  is this good  Like most people  Ive been eating ketchup my whole life and never really thought anything about it  Then Hubby brought a jar of this home  The tomato flavor is amazing  I will never buy store ketchup every again  Sir Kensingtons did a great job of updating the classic ketchup with this wonderful product  The refreshed taste of this Ketchup is a great update  and now leaves me disappointed when Im given Heinz while out at a restaurant   br    br   For you Heinz die hard fans out there  this is not the ketchup for you  But for those of you who wish you always knew what ketchup could be without the chemical aftertaste found in Heinz  be sure to give this Ketchup a try   br    br   Dont forget the spiced variety  Purchasing the pack with both the classic and spiced variety for your first Sir Kensington experience is definitely the way to go  This is ridiculous  The best gourmet ketchup I have ever tasted  It is pricey  but wow  love this stuff  It would make a great gift for someone who is hard to buy for but loves their ketchup  Yummy  The tomatoes are the star of the classic flavor  It is clean and really fresh  Perfect on an avocado chicken sandwich   br    br   The spicy flavor is more complex and is the best ketchup I have ever tried  It is so good I have now used it on foods that would make me seem crazy  The spicy version of this ketchup isnt bad  but it is too expensive  The regular version is sweet as dessert  Horrible  Annies Organic has a much better flavor and costs a lot less  Even Heinz organic is a better deal  I gave it three stars instead of two because it is in glass  not plastic  These condiments are overpriced and terrible  The classic is disgustingly sweet  The spiced tastes like a bad spicy marinara sauce from a chain restaurant  I have been using porcini mushrooms in my cooking for twenty plus years  The Roland extra fancy porcinis that I purchased from you are the best that I have ever used  including the mushrooms that I bought in Italy and transported back to the USA  I was pretty pleased with these mushrooms  They were mostly large pieces  rehydrated well and had good flavor  Id estimate about 25  of the contents were broken into medium to small pieces  most likely due to the shaking about in transit  Not a problem since I sometimes break the large pieces into smaller ones for some recipes  There was a small amount  perhaps an ounce or so  of very small  mincedsize  dustlike pieces  Still useful to add into gravies and the like  Nothing gets wasted   br    br   The label says it is a product of China and Italy  Nothing was specified as to the proportion from each country   br    br   Im quite fond of dried mushrooms  While they may lack the texture you can get only when using fresh ones  the convenience of always having them on hand is a big plus  Additionally  I find the broth used to rehydrate them adds a wonderful flavor to soups and stews  To save time and add flavor  I sometimes add the dried mushrooms directly into the soup or stew without rehydrating them  Really helps meld all the flavors together  I also am fond of adding some to the cooking water when boiling pasta  The pasta picks up a wonderful earthy flavor when it cooks in the mushroominfused water   br    br   This was the first time I used the Roland brand  got it on a price dip from the Amazon Warehouse   and would certainly buy them again  Highly recommend  If you are a peanut lover  these are for you  Much larger than cocktail peanuts  Six people on my Christmas gift list ask for these every year   The cashews were nice and big  with the vast majority being whole  There were a number of small pieces at the bottom of the bag  but thats pretty expected with so many cashews  They made an absolutely excellent cashew brittle   br    br   My order took just over a week to arrive  which was pretty decent considering it was shipped across the country  They came double bagged in clear plastic bags  and in two 5 lb portions  This was highly convenient since I could just throw one of the bags into the freezer until I was ready to work with it   br    br   Great value for the price  Although there were several  shriveled  ones  they taste just fine  I mostly use them to make vegan sauces and other recipes that call for running them through a food processor so they dont have to look perfect anyways  For the price  they are a great deal  about half of what I find them for in the store  I ordered these after a fair bit of searching online  even ordering the smaller 13 oz bags  I will admit  I was a bit sceptical when I ordered this since it was not cheap and had no idea how good  or bad  the cashews would be   br    br   The order came in pretty fast  like 3 days  The cashews were fresh and whole  with like 10 broken pieces  They were in 2 5lb bags sealed with clear tape  first I found it odd but then it turned out to be a good deal  considering the second pack stayed fresh till I opened them  The trick is to actually keep them in an airtight box so that they stay fresh longer   br    br   The only negative I can think of is that the price went up abt  500 for the 10lb since I bought them  These nuts arrived fresh and are very tasty  They are not broken or dirty looking like cashews sometimes can  I bought these for my boyfriend who really likes honey roasted pecans in salads that I have at a couple of restaurants  Plus  he likes nuts  pecans  almonds peanuts  He loved these  I actually ordered 3 cans instead of the gift tin  so he could take one to work  or his place  and stay fresh longer  Although I dont think freshness will be an issue  they wont last long  lol My cat will go for a day  probably longer  havent tryed it  but hell walk right by this stuff every time  even when I know hes hungery  ABSOLUTELY NO INTEREST  I swear hed rather die of starvation then even take a wiff of it   Got this free with another order I placed  I couldnt believe how much the cats loved it  I will buy again for sure  This is a great ham soup base  I have used it in Ham and beans and seasoned greenbeans  Great flavor I havent used the ham base  It is loaded with MSG  I did not realize this when I ordered it and can not return it because it is a food item Before I discover this mix on Amazon I always bought it in Whole Food Store   br   I like this mix and when I am doing the pancakes they came very delicious and fluffy   br   Just one small secret  Try to add the Seltzer water instead of regular one  I appreciate the fact that I can buy this product online and have free shipping  This is a great all around mix that is very good with a wonderful texture  Thanks again amazon  Arrowhead Mills Buttermilk Pancake mix is my favorite mix  It tastes great  cooks up light and fluffy and is super easy to make  Although it can be made using water  I think its better made with milk  I love it with pure organic maple syrup  The pancakes taste great without any recipe adjustments for my sons egg allergy  Its also great for camping or any time youd like to be able to make pancakes without having fresh eggs available  HEY  These are GREAT Waffles and Pancakes  We have to add 50  more mix  tho  as the recipies on the bag

an allergy   br   They taste fine for our family  we like them many ways  I love the flour however Amazon sent it with a book which broke a bag and made a mess  Customer sevice took care of the problem however it was a foolish way to ship the product  This mix is very poorly packaged and breaks open easily during shipping  Nearly a full bag of my order was spilled in the shipping box  3 bags out of 4 had come unsealed at the top  There were no tears in the packages  Just awful  I thought food was supposed to taste good  I had to eat ice cream afterwards to get the taste out of my mouth  its that bad  Perhaps the worst bottle of wine Ive ever had  Im not even sure I would cook with this  It is thin  no body  and a transparent color not characteristic of a good pinot  The taste is just bitter  not the complexity that I expect from a pinot noir of any price  Just not what Im looking for even in a low to mid price pinot noir  Maybe my bottle wasnt sealed well and went to vinegar  other reviews for this wine are favorable  A good tasting light chip that has some value in nutrition  Everyone get the munchies  is this is a good alternative to eating potato chips  This is a wonderful warm flavored tea  especially now in colder weather   br   This tea has a sweet  soothing chamomile fragrance  It is subtle and sweetIt  s one of the better chamomile teas   br   If you find it hard to sleep at times  a cup of this sweet chamomile tea may help   br   If you really like sweet taste try Bigelow Chamomile Mango Herbal Tea   br   I highly recommend both  This is one of the best mint chocolate syrup Ive ever had so far  The others pale in flavor by comparison  There are only seven ingredients in this sauce  including organic natural mint flavor  In the past I used ice cream heavy with other flavors like butterscotch  chocolate chips  Oreo cookies  caramel et al  because the mint flavor of other mint chocolate sauces was too pale  Now I buy plain vanilla or chocolate ice cream and the minty flavor of the Santa Cruz Organic Mint Chocolate syrup really stands out but doesnt overpower the flavor of the ice cream  There are only 110 calories  And because the mint flavor is very apparent to my taste  I use it sparingly  so this 155 oz container last a bit longer than the other syrups I used  This is a simple product and it is simply good  There are no extra ingredients that are hard to pronounce and have you scouring the internet finding out what they are  It is a bit thinner consistency than the usual syrup  so use caution the first time you go to squeeze some out  This will be great for people who like mint  it has a much stronger mint flavor than chocolate  I use it in my coffee with a bit of half and half  tastes great  Sometimes simple is better  A grande item  Delicious fish with the ultimate flavor  best ever in a can for all purposes  I sent a case to my Mother recently diagnosed with Diabetes  and she loves it as a main entree for cooking patties  I ordered this product at the same time as the Kirkland Signature salmon  The Raincoast Trading Co  salmon is very tasty  equally as good quality salmon as the Kirkland  However  the Raincoast arrived in perfect condition  the Kirkland cans were dented badly  I recommend this product to anyone who likes boneless skinless canned salmon  This tea tastes almost as good as the tea you would get at an Indian restaurant  Its much better than getting a teabag and making it the English way  with a lot of water and a bit of milk  This is very creamy and tasty  My only criticism is that there arent enough sachets in the box  Only 10  Since the directions say that you use one sachet for 100ml of water  approximately half a cup   its not enough for a good cup of tea  so I use two  That means that one box is only good enough for five cups of tea  But its a delicious afterdinner drink  I would buy this again if there were more sachets in a box  i love this product cant find it locally  Sometimes little out of the way stores have itBut i also love the chicken  pork chop bagsEvery store i go in i look for them the lastplace i found it was at a meat market  This is the best way to cook a roast  Our local grocery went out of buisness and so I could not find this product till I looked here  Please continue to keep this product available  Its always a pleasure to find Frenchs products on the web  All of the markets in my area have made a bargain to carry nothing but McCormacks bland and tasteless seasonings   br    br   This is the most flavorful cooking bag mix you will ever find  If you like Oreos or the Oreo cakester  then youve got to try the Double Stuff cakesters    These are the best   Side note  shipping was very slow  but maybe your chances will be better  I was surprised about how good this was my family and friends laughed when I told them I bought this  But out of the can ready mix with a little salt  pepper  spinach  and some cheese and its a great easy meal  The thing about Marmite is that those who dont like it hate it  and those who love it cant live without it  Its very much  an English thing  and the language has even adopted the trade name as a metaphor  as in  Victoria Beckham is Marmite  meaning that those who dont like her  etc    Amazon has done the world a favor by making this weird and wonderful stuff available at an affordable price  Last time I looked  it was  25 a 500g jar in British stores in LACounty  or about 4x what it costs in England  The Amazon supplier was quick and efficient  and I now have enough Marmite to last me to the end of the year  or would have  if I didnt decide to send one of the two jars to my son in Japan    Good job  Amazon  A vile  miserable pancake  I put these in front of my toddler one morning and she actually cried  I dont know if it was their flat and anemic appearance or their salty bitter taste  Only the whole wheat flour is organic in this mix  The buttermilk  baking soda  SLS  and sea salt are not  I am going back to Natures Path Buttermilk pancake mix  This one went straight into the garbage  Whats there to say about a fantastic chocolate chip cookie  The only thing that could be improved is if they offered a bushel box of these so you would not run out so fast  Hope these dont go the way of the dinosaur  These arrived on time and packaged in green plastic wrap  The cookies were as fresh as the boxes found in the local grocery store   br    br   I have no complaints but I also now have no more cookies  We ate them all  I was not expecting to like these cookies as much as I do  I like chocolate chip cookies well enough  but I really prefer a soft cookie to crisp ones  I have to say these Famous Amos cookies have pertty much turned me around  The cookies are rich and have that depth of flavor that comes from quality ingredients  The chips are real chocolate and melt redilly in your mouth creating a moist experience while chewing  These are truly great cookies  They arent fattening and theyre good for you  right  Thats what I heard  at least  from an admittedly unreliable person  Great if you are cutting back on fat  they do resemble regular chips but are nothing like them  Extremely dry and hard  I have never met a Kettle brand chip I did not like  These chips have a great loaded potato flavor  which are flavorful  I like the sweet onion chips better  but these are also at the top of the list for greattasting potato chips  Kettle chips are great chips f  the money  After buying bags one at a time  at a hefty markup  at nearby stores  I decided to try bulk ordering some snack foods on Amazon  I was very pleased with the price and the products   br    br   These jalapeno kettle chips are not overly spicy  they have a slowbuilding spice that starts very subtly a grows if you eat the whole bag  which Im embarrassed to say I did quite a few times   br    br   The chips arrived wellpacked and fresh  They had nearly a year of time before they expired  which is pretty impressive for chips   br    br   Most importantly  the priceperbag was much  MUCH better than any local store could do  although I live near an expensive city  so that may play a role in the price difference   br    br   I wouldnt hesitate to order another box of these once I run out  I buy mostly for vending  so the size of the bag is important  Kettles 1 oz bag is a good size although it seems a bit less than full  Salt  Vinegar flavor is satisfying  about an 8 out of 10  Glad to find these in a one ounce size but the bag seems a bit less than full  Its hard to find single serving chip bags that vend well  Sometimes they are too wide  or too plump with air  Bag size is good  BBQ flavor is about an 8 out of 10  one of the best chips that you can buy  and ive tried all the kettle varieties  and many others  Theres only a slight taste of jalapeno  and they are delicious  Perfect with a sandwich or alone   br   If you like being addicted  these are the chip for you   See you at addicts anonymous  The title says it all  Great flavor  hint of spice  excellent crunch  We eat Kettle chips by the truck load at my house  we like all the flavors but this one far and away is our favorite  never enough bags to get us to our next shipment  I just wish Amazon could get the larger bags on subscribe and save  If you buy these make sure you have enough for everyone otherwise you may not get enough for yourself    WOW  I have eaten quite a few potato chips in my day  Kettle chips are the BEST nonbaked chips I have eaten  I decided to try the sweet onion chips  since Ive never had them  I now have a FAVORITE   If you like onions  this is a MUST buy  I will definitely reorder these  as I mentioned above  they are the BEST I have ever eaten  The flavor is GREAT  I cannot say how much I love Kettle brand potato chips  Kettle brand has a large variety of unique flavors  and the quality of the chips themselves blows all other potato chips out of the water  The ingredients list is printed on each bag and the only thing really bad for it is the oil they are frying the chips in  I love that these arent filled with nasty chemicals  I ordered the cheddar and sour cream krinkle cut ones which are great but I was torn between the  a href      Kettle Brand Potato Chips Fully Loaded Baked Potato  2  Ounce  Pack of 24  a and the Jalapeno flavor  While I know the jalapeno flavor is good but this is way better  They include liquid smoke instead of actual bacon which Im fine with since Ive a vegetarian  I ordered this to give to guests coming from out of town for my wedding this spring and I cant guarantee how many I will have left  My fiance and I love these  The packaging is perfect for anyone who is giving these to kids to take for school lunches  or handing out in gift bags  even just for portion control  Now  I havent done a sidebyside comparison  but these chips still taste like the real deal  These snack sized bags do as well as the regular brand at the grocery store I work for  Portion control AND reduced fat  Yes  please  With the Subscribe  Save these are much cheaper than at the grocery store  I love Kettle Brand Chips   br   Ive been in love with the Honey Dijon for years and decided to try out their other flavors   br    br   Sea Salt  Vinegar Chips are TANGY  SOUR  and make my lips pucker when I eat too many at a time  I got 12 big bags for a steal from amazon   11 WHAT       br    br   Personally  the flavor is too much for me  but my mom  aunt LOVE them and they hate potato chips  These chips are thick and crunchy  I absolutely love them  The taste is perfect  I like to buy these smaller bags because I cant trust myself with a large bag of these because they taste no good  I enjoy these chips  I got these instead of my usual jalapeno ones from the same company for a bit of flavor change  I think those are better but only slightly  like the jalapenos there is a great amount of flavor without being too overpowering  The small bag size prevents you from overeating as with a larger bag  I love these chips  I buy the 24 pack once a month  The bags are just the right size for snacking and prevent me from eating way too much with the larger bags  The jalapeno spice is subtle enough not to be overpowering but still gives you a great amount of flavor  These are the strongest tasting salt and vinegar chips Ive had  I could still do with more vinegar flavor  but I think this is as close as Im going to get without dousing them with vinegar powder myself   br    br   I did a side by side with the Cape Cod salt and vinegar and these are about twice as flavorful  Additionally  as other reviewers have said  they have quite a good bit of potassium in them  somewhere in the neighbor of 15  RDA per serving   I have been ordering the sea salt chips for about a year  I love them  but my daughter picked some of these up at our local grocery store and now they are my new favoriteWill be ordering them  These are my favorite glutenfree dairyfree flavored chips  Many other salt and vinegar chips contain dairy so its nice to find ones that I can eat  The vinegar flavor is really intense and good  These Kettle Brand potato chips in the Spicy Thai flavor really do taste like food I have eaten at a Thai restaurant  The ingredients listed include garlic powder  onion powder  parsley  jalapeno  and  spices   Im not sure what other spices there are  but it sure tastes like lemongrass to me  yum  These chips are thick cut and very crunch  They come in a seriously heavyduty bag  I tried to open it like I do regular chip bags by pulling the two sides apart  no way  The bag is so thick I wondered if it was plastic  I started looking for the scissors and decided that any company that put their chips in a bag this nice must have provided a way to open it  Sure enough  there is a small slit on the top and the simple directions  tear here   So easy  Why didnt I think of that  Honey Dijon flavor  okay flavor  but both my girlfriend and I thought they left a bad aftertaste  The aftertaste is sort of like old cheese  presumably some folks like this  Im not a fancy cheese eater   and it lingers for at least an hour  Id give this flavor a rating of 2 stars out of 5   br    br   We have also tried the NY Cheddar flavor  4 stars   which we both liked better  and they didnt leave any longlingering or bad aftertaste   br    br   Id give the consistency of the chips 4 stars  The chips are crunchy  but also greasy enough that I keep a napkin near or wash my hands after eating Kettle Chips  For me  Kettle is the best brand on the market  They really know how to turn the humble potato into something fit for the gods  I didnt think anything could top their salt and pepper chips  but these are my new favorite  The flavors are pure and real  They go great with just about everything and are highly addictive  I hope they come out with a low fat version  their low fat chips are excellent but they need more flavors  Salt and vinegar chips are definitely my favorite type of any potato chip  These ones made by Kettle were very tasty and I enjoyed them thoroughly  I just wish there was a more healthy option with the same great taste  What I like about them   br   1  Very thick chips   br   2  No trans fat and all natural  according to the info on the bag   br   3  Flavor  but thats a subjective thing   br   4  2oz bags  which keep you from eating too much at one time  Just set a limit of 1 bag   br    br   Cons   br   As another reviewer said  theres a lot of oil in them chips  What I do is place a paper napkin on a plate and pour the chips on them  Wait a few mins before eating and the napkin will soak some of the oil off  It seems gross that there is so much oil on the chip that a napkin will soak it off  but its true  And at least this way  youll get rid of some of the oil  These are so tangy it prevents me from eating too many  a handful or two does the trick  Very crisp and savory  I usually love Kettle Chips  and love salt  vinegar  but these chips were way too vinegary for me  They do have the typical kettle chip crunch  but are too aggressively flavored for my taste  I have always been a fan of Kettle chips  When you open a bag of Kettle chips you know you are going to get quality  These chips are no exception and live up to the name printed on the package   br    br   The New York Cheddar chips have a very subtle flavor to them  You can taste the cheddar in them  but it doesnt smack you in the face like supermarket brand chips might  The taste lingers as well which is a definite plus   br    br   Another aspect about these Kettle chips is the fact every chip is nice and crisp  that crunch in your mouth  On top of that there are no burnt chips in any of the bags I have had since the purchase  The only negative I might have is that the flavoring of the chips is uneven  Some chips might pack a nice cheddar punch while another might taste rather plain  This isnt a big flaw as it happens when getting seasoned and doesnt ruin the bag at all   br    br   Overall the quality of the chips is fantastic  The flavor is great and you wont  be disappointed  especially if you are a cheddar lover  Tried many varieties of BBQ chips and hands down these are the BEST on the market  These R not too salty or greasy  Great crispy crunch  Plenty of good BBQ flavor with a hint of sweetness that all other brands fall short of  Every bag  after bag  is just as mouth wateringly delicious as the 1st   Kettle chis are the best ever  These used to be my favorite flavor until I tried their Salt and Pepper kind but Im sure this is just a personal preference   br    br   Crunchy  real potato chips  These chips have the right amount of crunch and I enjoy the taste  Chips are consistent and have a fairly even distribution of seasoning  I like the 2  oz size bags  just the right amount of chips  I subscribed to these  one case every three months  That comes out to about  5 a month for the convenience of having my favorite chips handy whenever I want  Because it seems FritoLay has managed to crowd out every other chip vendor from pretty much all my local stores this is the best way to ensure a steady supply of the items I want rather than the items FritoLay wants me to have  The two ounce bags are larger than you might be used to buying at the Subway  for example  which I find works very well  theyre large enough to be a good snack on their own  or you can even share a single bag over lunch  The size is perfect for ensuring these fantastically crunchy chips are always fresh  no chip clip needed   br    br   The only problem  I subscribed to four cases a year and having these yummy chips always in the pantry makes it really easy to increase ones Kettle chip consumption  Definitely have to hide the case from the kids  OK  I did read the reviews which ranged from splendid to awful  I took the plunge as I do like salty  and tangy flavors  No  I had never had these before I took the leap and ordered a case at a super price  They arrived quickly and in great shape with the sell by date FEB 2011  Umm  Im in the middle on these chips  they are OK but not something I cant live without  I love the crunch  the color  NO TRANS FAT  They are a little too vinegary for my taste  which is a lot coming from a kid that grew up eating pickled hardboiled eggs and pickled pigs feet   br    br   I havent tried them with a deli sandwich and a cold mug of beer which might improve the experience  This was the best deal ever  The delivery was fast  the chips are delicious and very fresh  Love it  My husband and I LOVE these chips  Personally I think the flavor is perfect  Try them for yourself  The barbeque flavor of these chips is really perfect  Just spicy enough  a hint of sweetness  just a little smokey  The chips themselves are extra crunchy and just thick enough to be substantial  but not hard  This makes for a wonderful snack or a great accompaniment for burgers  hot dogs or brats  chicken or just about any casual entree  I was hesitant to buy this at my local grocery store  Lunds  but they were on sale  so I bought a bag  Ive found that going beyond the simplyflavored chips  like cheddar or vinegar  usually results in disappointment  Tried the Thai or asianinspired chips by Target  Archer Farms  and they were awful  These Kettle Spicy Thai chips are just awesome  so much so  that Im considering buying them in bulk from Amazon  The taste is complicated and stimulates different parts of the palate  The taste sensations prevalent in real Thai food is baked into this chip  sweet  salty  spicy  Was sour in there too  I dont know  but this is a wellmade wellbalanced chip that is addicting  As a professional potato chip muncher  I see these as thee very BEST on the market  Rich taste and flavor   Almost impossible not to finish the entire bagThe true meaning of decadence  These are handsdown the absolute best Salt  Vinegar chips you can buy  They have a great  strong flavor that has left me addicted  These are certainly my favorite chips  I highly recommend trying them  Oh  I love these chips  And theyre so hard to find where I am  and when I do find them  theyre usually  12 more per bag for less  Great that these are so cheap here at Amazon  I LOVE these chips  It is a little weird to review potato chips  But these chips are great  The crunch is just right  plus they have just the right amount of salt  Not to salty not too bland  They are a little oily but thats ok  The best thing is the 2 oz package  When I buy a larger bag its harder to resist eating them all  This 2 oz package allows for a little  portion control   Be sure to use your scissors to open   cause these chips are packaged for freshness and dont open easily  Enjoy  In the past couple years I have eaten and reviewed several kinds and styles of chips  from the best Ive ever had to big disappointments  If you have eaten the LantChips varieties  there is no way that they are not the best as a group  the Kettle chips are rightly salted and I was so irritated by some Pringles products  Kettle has good flavor but the small size and overwhelming oiliness takes away from the flavors  All in all  its good to have choiceAmazon does not stock the LantChips all the time so there are some days that there is no choice  these chips are good  and bad  and create moral dilemmas constantly  If wou are strong at will  or having a large BBQ go for it  but as for me  i was in the habit of bringing a new bag to work every three days  had to put in a lot of time on the treadmill to make up for it  BEWARE Kettle Chips flavors can be hit or miss  Some of their flavors are terrible  But this is very simple and delicious  Probably one of their best flavors   br    br   Pros  Thick  crunchy potato chips with light salt that doesnt compromise on taste  ecofriendly business that isnt just giving us lip service  br    br   Cons  The occasional burnt chip and the bag is a pain to open  They have a tab that you can pull down but most of the time I end up tearing down the entire side of the bag  Use scissors instead  We bought these chips at a little sandwich shop in Sonoma while we were on vacation  I wasnt sure what to expect by the package  and at first bite I didnt know what to think  and then all of the flavors hit   br   Yum  They are a bit spicy  but nothing overpowering  Just lots of crunchy  sweet  spicy goodness  They arent sold everywhere though  Im still trying to find them somewhere close to where I live  I have to admit that those chips are so good that they are highly addictive  I cant stop eating them    Its crunchy and seasoned at the right amount of flavor and salt  Just perfect    Believe me  some chips are so salty  I cant finish a small bag  But this one  I just keep on eating  These are some of the best chips that I have ever had  They sure beat anything else out there and are even cooked in a way that is better for you than most other name brands  They are tangy and crisp and satisfy any craving at the time  These will be the only chips that I buy from now on and I thank amazon for letting me buy them online in bulk and save some money at the same time  Im addicted to salty and tangy flavors  so when I opened my first bag of Sea Salt  Vinegar Kettle Brand chips I knew I had a perfect complement to my vegetable trays of cucumber  carrot  celery and cherry tomatoes  Skip the dip  balance the tangy chips by alternating bites of raw vegetable   br    br   As an Oregonian  Im proud to share these delectable snacks with friends  especially those living outside our state and who havent

 Classically  a Germanstyle Riesling fits these parameters perfectly   These chips remind me of a long obsolete brand of chips we could get in middle school  They are by far the tastiest chips Ive had and its impossible to walk past the aisle without picking up the trademark blue bag and then putting the bag clip on the bag  These are by far my favorite chips  they are extremely crunchy  similar to other Kettle style chips   but its the extreme Vinegar flavor that differentiates these from lesser fried potato snacks  Ive tried several other brands of Salt and Vinegar and none of them come close  They are good but need more cheese and wish they were krinkle cut  I much prefer the salt  pepper just for the krinkle cut  they have a better texture  All around this brand is much better than FritoLay and a good price on Amazon when you get free shipping  These are similar to Tims or Zacks chips in that they are very crispy   br    br   On a side note  these are the hardest bags to open by hand  I have to use a knife or scissors everytime  It took a while to get used to these chips but they are pretty good and more healthy for you  They sure were eaten all up by my family and friends  These are delicious  The 2 oz bags are a bit big for school lunches  definitely more than a serving  I recently tried this flavor  brand and was surprised at how delicious these chips are  The best thing was that there were a lot of  brown  chips in the bsg  my favorite   so I bought some more through amazon and shared with family and friends  I am a little disappointed that there are not  so far  very many brown chips in these bags  but the flavor is still very good  I like them better than the yogurt and green onion flavor because they do not seem to be as salty  and the onion flavor is better  If you havent eaten Kettle chips before  I recommend that you try a bag before buying bulk  They are thicker and crunchier than Lays but just as fresh out of the bag  We are always pleased with Amazons packaging  Chips are never crushed or broken  always fresh  We really liked this brand  flavor of chips  Very tasty  These chips are some of the best Ive tasted  They are not filled with chemicals  You taste the tangy vinegar as well as the potato  Not greasy  Perfectly crispy  If you dont like salt and vinegar tanginess  dont even bother to try  These definitely have zip  I love them  My children and their friends love them  Even my 4 year old loves them  These chips were a great deal  Kettle was having a special deal for the case of chips  They are hard to find in Vegas and are my favorite flavor  Shipping was very fast  sooner than expected  fantastic  you can not beat this taste and you can not resist to it only one if you are spice lover Eat at your own risk  Once I would open a bag I could not stop  Good and salty  I dont eat many chips  but these I love  Great buy and arrived quick and packed great  Expiration date is a ways away  so I have awhile to enjoy them Great natural potato flavor  I love brown russet  hardy flavor and these fit that description to a tee  I simply fell in love with these chips and refused to share them with my friends    My experience with a lot of cheesefavored chips has been too salty and a little over the greasy side  But these NY Cheddar from Kettle really changed my mind  Thanks to Amazon for great discounts and I dont have to buy them from the store anymore  Bought this box of chips as a Fathers Day gift because Dad loves them  They are very yummy and more substantial than regular chips  These chips are quite tasty and the price is right  Packaged very well  would buy again  I like Kettle chips but was really disappointed with this order because they were over cooked  I bought a bigger sized bag from Costco and the chips were all cooked perfectly  So I dont know why these were different   br   Will never buy these chips from here again  For some reason Amazon would not ship these to Alaska   so I sent them to my grandchildren who got to enjoy them  They are very good chips  Amazon should rethink the shipping to Alaska thing  I would order groceries online  My husband likes these a lot  They are a bit different to get used to as they are less greasy and salty in taste than the usual chips you buy  They are more browner than I would like to see and the chips are pretty sturdy in texture  Not bad  though  Just takes getting used to eating chips better for your health  They do have about 12 the calories in fat  however  Just got this order and it is ok  A bit light on the cheddar flavoring and herb taste eludes me  if it is there  I really love Kettle brand chips  but these are rather disappointing  There is very little sour cream or onion flavor  I took one and said good Russet potato chip but I found that the flavoring was subtle for my taste  a bit oily and overcooked  It may be because I am use to eating their great tasting  a href      Kettle Chips Spicy Thai  2  Ounce Bags  Pack of 24  a  Or perhaps because all the chips in the bags I received were overcooked and that overpowered the seasoning  It is obvious the chips are flavored  but if I did not read the bag I would never have thought it had Cheddar flavor  And I love New York Cheddar  The flavoring included Parmesan  Cheddar  Blue Cheese  garlic and other spices  A good chip even when overcooked  but I do not plan to buy them again  I took one and said good Russet potato chip but where is the flavoring  Then all of a sudden  within seconds  it spread to my senses and my taste buds were happy  As close to Thai food as a potato chip can get  These chips are spicy enough to satisfy that craving for spice and a hint of sweetness that makes them habit forming  The flavoring included garlic  ginger  jalapeno  cilantro and other spices  and it just felt great to eat these  I will buy these again  These were a treat  I agree with the other review  these chips are not for a sore mouth or tender gums  The chips are very hard and the taste is delightful if you enjoy the salt  vinegar combo  Unfortunately  every bag I received in that case was over cooked  They were very dark and only a few golden brown chips in each bag  They definitely need to improve that  We love Kettle Chips Lightly Salted and dont feel guilty eating them  We used to buy them at Whole Foods but buying from Amazon has saved us money  We have purchased at least 3 times and have been happy with the chips and the delivery  A friend of mine brought these into work with the claim   these will change your life   While my life is fairly unchanged  I cannot get enough of these chips     and I do not even like kettle chips  For the most part  I find Kettle Chips to be too thick and greasy  but the flavor of these chips is amazing  The are the type of hot that is refreshing  If you do not enjoy spicy or hot things    try these anyway  they may convert you  But if you happen to  like me  there is no better sea salt and vinegar chip Ive found in this country  These are the best potato chips Ive ever tasted  Its easy to go through half of a bag without stopping  The texture  crunchiness is just perfect  as is the salt and vinegar combination  I dont know how they taste so much better than all of the other chips Ive ever had  but they do  And  judging from the nutrition facts  they seem to be healthier  too  Theyre somewhat fibrous and have a good bit of potassium and vitamin c  which could be because they dont skin the potatoes and the chips are a bit thicker than normal   br    br   And if you like these  all of the Kettle chips are great  i rarely eat chips but i saw these and tried them  they are really amazing  i love cheddar too  but the chips are really thin and crunch and delicious flavor  i recommend them  This is easily the best potato chip that I have ever had  Look at the ingredients  Ginger and 3 types of hot pepper  How can you go wrong   br    br   Obviously  not for you if you dont like spicy food  But  if you DO like spicy food  youll probably love these  They have that hotwithahintofsweetness flavor combo that is prevalent in a lot of Thai food  Kettle Chips Spicy Thai potato chips have the perfect amount of sweet  savory and spicy   everything youd want in a good meal or better yet  a potato chip  Since these are kettlecooked  the chips are uniquely shaped and are sometimes a bit overbrowned  They are  however  sliced just perfectly  not too thick  not too thin  so you can actually get a great crunch with each bite without breaking a tooth off  The flavor is tremendous  although I wouldnt describe it as Thai  Its more of a vague  sweet and tangy flavor with a kick  and every now and then you get a great big hit of ginger  If you like any spice at all  these really are not overly spicy  so most people can handle them  The fact that these chips have absolutely no artificial ingredients or trans fat makes them a fabulous addition to any munchers snack cupboard  Okay  I should not eat potato chips  nor should anyone   br   But these are so spicy  I would find it hard to eat  br   very many  That makes them an indulgence that  br   rescues some people from overindulgence  I dont write very many reviews but I have to say that Kettle Brand chips are the best I have ever tasted  Every flavor is dynamite  If you are feeling iffy about honey dijon  I would recommend cheddar beer  absolutely amazing  And theyre healthy   besides a lil fat  I have eaten a lot of chips in my day and Kettle takes the cake  Enjoy  and dont eat them too fast

      "i have bought several of the vitality canned dog food products and have found them all to be of good quality the product looks more like a stew than a processed meat and it smells better my labrador is finicky and she appreciates this product better than most product arrived labeled as jumbo salted peanuts the peanuts were actually small sized unsalted not sure if this was an error or if the vendor intended to represent the product as jumbo this is a confection that has been around a few centuries it is a light pillowy citrus gelatin with nuts in this case filberts and it is cut into tiny squares and then liberally coated with powdered sugar and it is a tiny mouthful of heaven not too chewy and very flavorful i highly recommend this yummy treat if you are familiar with the story of c s lewis the lion the witch and the wardrobe this is the treat that seduces edmund into selling out his brother and sisters to the witch if you are looking for the secret ingredient in robitussin i believe i have found it i got this in addition to the root beer extract i ordered which was good and made some cherry soda the flavor is very medicinal great taffy at a great price there was a wide assortment of yummy taffy delivery was very quick if your a taffy lover this is a deal i got a wild hair for taffy and ordered this five pound bag the taffy was all very enjoyable with many flavors watermelon root beer melon peppermint grape etc my only complaint is there was a bit too much red black licoriceflavored pieces just not my particular favorites between me my kids and my husband this lasted only two weeks i would recommend this brand of taffy it was a delightful treat this saltwater taffy had great flavors and was very soft and chewy each candy was individually wrapped well none of the candies were stuck together which did happen in the expensive version fralingers would highly recommend this candy i served it at a beachthemed party and everyone loved it this taffy is so good it is very soft and chewy the flavors are amazing i would definitely recommend you buying it very satisfying right now im mostly just sprouting this so my cats can eat the grass they love it i rotate it around with wheatgrass and rye too this is a very healthy dog food good for their digestion also good for small puppies my dog eats her required amount at every feeding i dont know if its the cactus or the tequila or just the unique combination of ingredients but the flavour of this hot sauce makes it one of a kind we picked up a bottle once on a trip we were on and brought it back home with us and were totally blown away when we realized that we simply couldnt find it anywhere in our city we were bummed br br now because of the magic of the internet we have a case of the sauce and are ecstatic because of it br br if you love hot sauce i mean really love hot sauce but dont want a sauce that tastelessly burns your throat grab a bottle of tequila picante gourmet de inclan just realize that once you taste it you will never want to use any other sauce br br thank you for the personal incredible service one of my boys needed to lose some weight and the other didnt i put this food on the floor for the chubby guy and the proteinrich no byproduct food up higher where only my skinny boy can jump the higher food sits going stale they both really go for this food and my chubby boy has been losing about an ounce a week my cats have been happily eating felidae platinum for more than two years i just got a new bag and the shape of the food is different they tried the new food when i first put it in their bowls and now the bowls sit full and the kitties will not touch the food ive noticed similar reviews related to formula changes in the past unfortunately i now need to find a new food that my cats will eat good flavor these came securely packed they were fresh and delicious i love these twizzlers the strawberry twizzlers are my guilty pleasure yummy six pounds will be around for a while with my son and i my daughter loves twizzlers and this shipment of six pounds really hit the spot its exactly what you would expect six packages of strawberry twizzlers i love eating them and they are good for watching tv and looking at movies it is not too sweet i like to transfer them to a zip lock baggie so they stay fresh so i can take my time eating them i am very satisfied with my twizzler purchase i shared these with others and we have all enjoyed them i will definitely be ordering more twizzlers strawberry my childhood favorite candy made in lancaster pennsylvania by y s candies inc one of the oldest confectionery firms in the united states now a subsidiary of the hershey company the company was established in 1845 as young and smylie they also make apple licorice twists green color and blue raspberry licorice twists i like them all br br i keep it in a dry cool place because is not recommended it to put it in the fridge according to the guinness book of records the longest licorice twist ever made measured 1200 feet 370 m and weighted 100 pounds 45 kg and was made by y s candies inc this recordbreaking twist became a guinness world record on july 19 1998 this product is kosher thank you candy was delivered very fast and was purchased at a reasonable price i was home bound and unable to get to a store so this was perfect for me my husband is a twizzlers addict weve bought these many times from amazon because were government employees living overseas and cant get them in the country we are assigned to theyve always been fresh and tasty packed well and arrive in a timely manner i bought these for my husband who is currently overseas he loves these and apparently his staff likes them also br there are generous amounts of twizzlers in each 16 ounce bag and this was well worth the price a href twizzlers strawberry 16 ounce bags pack of 6 a i can remember buying this candy as a kid and the quality hasnt dropped in all these years still a superb product you wont be disappointed with i love this candy after weight watchers i had to cut back but still have a craving for it i have lived out of the us for over 7 yrs now and i so miss my twizzlers when i go back to visit or someone visits me i always stock up all i can say is yum br sell these in mexico and you will have a faithful buyer more often than im able to buy them right now product received is as advertised br br a href twizzlers strawberry 16 ounce bags pack of 6 a the candy is just red no flavor just plan and chewy i would never buy them again i was so glad amazon carried these batteries i have a hard time finding them elsewhere because they are such a unique size i need them for my garage door opener br great deal for the price i got this for my mum who is not diabetic but needs to watch her sugar intake and my father who simply chooses to limit unnecessary sugar intake shes the one with the sweet tooth they both loved these toffees you would never guess that theyre sugarfree and its so great that you can eat them pretty much guilt free i was so impressed that ive ordered some for myself w dark chocolate to take to the office so ill eat them instead of snacking on sugary sweets br these are just excellent i dont know if its the cactus or the tequila or just the unique combination of ingredients but the flavour of this hot sauce makes it one of a kind we picked up a bottle once on a trip we were on and brought it back home with us and were totally blown away when we realized that we simply couldnt find it anywhere in our city we were bummed br br now because of the magic of the internet we have a case of the sauce and are ecstatic because of it br br if you love hot sauce i mean really love hot sauce but dont want a sauce that tastelessly burns your throat grab a bottle of tequila picante gourmet de inclan just realize that once you taste it you will never want to use any other sauce br br thank you for the personal incredible service i have never been a huge coffee fan however my mother purchased this little machine and talked me into trying the latte macciato no coffee shop has a better one and i like most of the other products too as a usually noncoffee drinker br the little dolche guesto machine is super easy to use and prepares a really good coffee latte cappuccino etc in less than a minute if water is heated up i would recommend the dolce gusto to anyone too good for the price and iam getting one myself this offer is a great price and a great taste thanks amazon for selling this product br br staral mccanns instant oatmeal is great if you must have your oatmeal but can only scrape together two or three minutes to prepare it there is no escaping the fact however that even the best instant oatmeal is nowhere near as good as even a store brand of oatmeal requiring stovetop preparation still the mccanns is as good as it gets for instant oatmeal its even better than the organic allnatural brands i have tried all the varieties in the mccanns variety pack taste good it can be prepared in the microwave or by adding boiling water so it is convenient in the extreme when time is an issue br br mccanns use of actual cane sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup helped me decide to buy this product real sugar tastes better and is not as harmful as the other stuff one thing i do not like though is mccanns use of thickeners oats plus water plus heat should make a creamy tasty oatmeal without the need for guar gum but this is a convenience product maybe the guar gum is why after sitting in the bowl a while the instant mccanns becomes too thick and gluey this is a good instant oatmeal from the best oatmeal brand it uses cane sugar instead of high fructouse corn syrup so not only does it have a better sweetness but some doctors now say that this form of sugar is better for you great on a cold morning when you dont have time to make mccanns steel cut oats the apple cinnamon is the best but the maple and brown sugar or the regular are good too plus they dont require doctoring to actually tell the three flavors apart instant oatmeal can become soggy the minute the water hits the bowl mccanns instant oatmeal holds its texture has excellent flavor and is good for you all at the same time mccanns regular oat meal is excellent too but may take a bit longer to prepare than most have time for in the morning this is the best instant brand ive ever eaten and a very close second to the noninstant variety br br mccanns instant irish oatmeal variety pack of regular apples cinnamon and maple brown sugar 10 count boxes pack of 6 mccanns instant irish oatmeal variety pack of regular apples cinnamon and maple brown sugar 10 count boxes pack of 6 br br im a fan of the mccanns steelcut oats so i thought id give the instant variety a try i found it to be a hardy meal not too sweet and great for folks like me postbariatric surgery who need food that is palatable easily digestible with fiber but wont make you bloat for those of us with celiac disease this product is a lifesaver and what could be better than getting it at almost half the price of the grocery or health food store i love mccanns instant oatmeal all flavors br br thanks br abby what else do you need to know oatmeal instant make it with a half cup of lowfat milk and add raisins nuke for 90 seconds more expensive than kroger store brand oatmeal and maybe a little tastier or better texture or something its still just oatmeal mmm convenient i was visiting my friend nate the other morning for coffee he came out of his storage room with a packet of mccanns instant irish oatmeal he suggested that i try it for my own use in my stash sometimes nate dose not give you a chance to say no so i ended up trying the apple and cinn found it to be very tastefull when made with water or powdered milk it goes good with o j and coffee and a slice of toast and your ready to take on the world or the day at least jerry reith i ordered this for my wife as it was reccomended by our daughter she has this almost every morning and likes all flavors shes happy im happy br a href mccanns instant irish oatmeal variety pack of regular apples cinnamon and maple brown sugar 10 count boxes pack of 6 a the variety packs taste great br br i have them every morning at 030 cents per meal i dont understand why everyone on earth isnt buying this stuff up br br maple and brown sugar is terrific followed by apples and cinnamon followed by regular you dont get tired of the same ole thing and they taste great br br i just boil water from a small pot empty the packet or 2 in a bowl pour in boiling water and watch it expand to 2x its size br br taste really good and takes minutes to prepare br br not sure why everyone on earth isnt this convenient healthy very quick excellent quality and extremely cheap mccanns makes oatmeal for every oatmeal connoisseur whether one likes it from the raw pellet state that cooks for half an hour to the sloth addled instant which can be done in the microwave for under three minutes its all good thats for sure and the beauty of the instant variety is that it is available in different flavors as well as regular br this variety pack allows different tastes to be explored as well as giving you a chance to experience the difference between mccanns and other wellknown oatmeals what i personally like about mccanns is that it cooks up thicker and with more body than the top brand here in america the apples cinnamon though tends to be a little liquidy so you may want to experiment with the amount of water you add in my 1300watt microwave the oatmeal cooks up in about one minute and twentyseven seconds so you should also watch that to get a handle on how much time and water to use br the only bad thing if you can consider it a bad thing about this offering is that you have to buy in lot so youll end up with six tencount boxes this is good if you have a whole family of oatmealeaters but if youre a single person alone well love oatmeal i have mccanns oatmeal every morning and by ordering it from amazon i am able to save almost 300 per box br it is a great product tastes great and very healthy mccanns oatmeal is a good quality choice our favorite is the apples and cinnamon but we find that none of these are overly sugary for a good hot breakfast in 2 minutes this is excellent we really like the mccanns steel cut oats but find we dont cook it up too often br this tastes much better to me than the grocery store brands and is just as convenient br anything that keeps me eating oatmeal regularly is a good thing this seems a little more wholesome than some of the supermarket brands but it is somewhat mushy and doesnt have quite as much flavor either it didnt pass muster with my kids so i probably wont buy it again good oatmeal i like the apple cinnamon the best though i wouldnt follow the directions on the package since it always comes out too soupy for my taste that could just be me since i like my oatmeal really thick to add some milk on top of the flavors are good however i do not see any differce between this and oaker oats brand they are both mushy i really like the maple and brown sugar flavor the regular is fine with brown sugar added the apples and cinnamon flavor is ok this is a very quick easy and satisfying breakfast and ill order this brand again but not the variety ill get all maple and brown sugar this is the same stuff you can buy at the big box stores there is nothing healthy about it it is just carbs and sugars save your money and get something that at least has some taste this oatmeal is not good its mushy soft i dont like it quaker oats is the way to go got a free package of these with a bottle of bloody mary mix i bought from the seller and the advertising worked lol i tried them and shared them with 2 buddies and we all loved them so im here to buy more and noticed there were no reviews yet well now there is they are hot but not burn your mouth forever hot its a nice temp perfect for us this wasnt in stock the last time i looked i had to go to the vermont country store in weston to find it along with a jaw harp cranberry horseradish sauce fartless black bean salsa apple cider jelly newtons cradle art in motion and the staple vermont maple syrup br br back to the ass kickin peanuts they are hot they will activate the perspiration glands behind your ears and under your arms it requires a beverage as advertised a glass of very cold milk and a box of kleenex since it will make your nose run they look like ordinary peanuts which is already giving me ideas for work i suspect that some people have been hitting my goodies in my absence especially my colleague greg im going to take this to work at earliest opportunity and empty the contents of this can into an ordinary planters peanuts can and then see whose crying or whose nose is running when i return br br the can should be shaken to ensure the spices are evenly distributed it is important to wash your hands after consumption and not touch the eyes br br youll go nuts over these asskickin peanuts br br p s im not sharing the peanuts not deliberately and ill probably give greg the jaw harp for christmas hell be so insulted were used to spicy foods down here in south texas and these are not at all spicy doubt very much habanero is used at all could take it up a notch or two i roast at home with a stovetop popcorn popper but i do it outside of course these beans coffee bean direct green mexican altura seem to be wellsuited for this method the first and second cracks are distinct and ive roasted the beans from medium to slightly dark with great results every time the aroma is strong and persistent the taste is smooth velvety yet lively we roast these in a large cast iron pan on the grill about 13 of the bag at a time the smell is wonderful and the roasted beans taste delicious too more importantly the coffee is smooth no bitter aftertaste on numerous occasions weve had to send the roasted beans home with friends because they like it so much deal was awesome arrived before halloween as indicated and was enough to satisfy trick or treaters i love the quality of this product and it was much less expensive than the local stores candy it is chocolate what can i say great variety of everything our family loves with a family of six it goes fast here perfect variety kit kat reeses take five and more great product nice combination of chocolates and perfect size the bags had plenty and they were shipped promptly the kids in the neighborhood liked our candies halloween is over but i sent a bag to my daughters class for her share the chocolate was fresh and enjoyed by many watch your prices with this while the assortment was good and i did get this on a gold box purchase the price for this was br 34 less at target this bag of candy online is pretty expensive it should be cheaper in order to compete with grocery stores other than that its a good combination of my favorite candy arrived in 6 days and were so stale i could not eat any of the 6 bags i have used the endurolyte product for several years in both pill and powder form long desert rides on the dirt bike always found my camelbak water heavily laced with the endurolyte powder not overly tasty but quite effective as i never got a cramp on these several hundred mile rides same for desert racing in the buggy the camelbaks were always laced with the powder now we have the fizz what a great product firstly its hammers endurolyte product so its great endurance athletes the world over use their products second its convenient handly tablets that dissovle in a fizz third it tastes great imagine getting a nice cool drink when your body is starving for hydration and electrolytes and rather than getting a salty taste you get a refreshing lemonlime or mango the camelbaks always get the fizz now i also drop a tablet in my bottled water whenever i exercise and have a nice flavored water chock full of electrolytes i can not recommend this product or any hammer product highly enough this product serves me well as a source of electrolytes during and after a long run or bike ride br i have tried all of the flavors but really do like the grapefruit flavor no aftertaste and i actually like the slight carbonation br i use other hammer products and really like their whole product line this stuff really works for preventing cramping during the middle to latter stages of your rides pop 1 into each water bottle and youre set flavor is fine and goes down easy for those of us on a low carb diet these little tablets are just the thing br br two years ago i started cycling again after many years but was having heart arrhythmia after longer rides in high heat i was drinking plain water but did a little research and thought electrolytes might be the issue gatorade wasnt an option because it is so loaded with carbohydrates so i looked around for a lowcarb alternative the zero carb sports drinks didnt help so what to do one day i ran across these at my bike shop so tried a tube of them voila problem solved br br ive shared them with two friends in particular whose problems with leg cramps were resolved while using these br br these guys got it right they are superbly formulated and simply work i purchased the mango flavor and to me it doesnt take like mango at all there is no hint of sweetness and unfortunately there is a hint or aftertaste almost like licorice ive been consuming various sports nutrition products for decades so im familiar and have come to like the taste of the most of the products ive tried the mango flavor is one of the least appealing ive tasted its not terrible but its bad enough that i notice the bad taste every sip i take if youre impulsive like me then 6 is ok dont get me wrong the quality of these babies is very good and i have no complaints but in retrospect the price is a little ridiculous esp when you add on the shipping this was sooooo deliscious but too bad i ate em too fast and gained 2 pds my fault these albanese gummi bears and rings and so on are very good and tasty and high quality the bears even have little faces at my local candy store this type of gummi stuff bears rings snakes balls worms whatever are about 10 lb these twin packs of 45 or 5 pound bags is a screaming deal as far as im concerned im probably 50 pounds deep in these friggin things consumed grape gummy bears are hard to find in my area in fact pretty much anyone i talk to about grape gummy bears they think im lying so i bought 10lbs these bears are a little bit bigger then the other brands and have kind of sour kick but nothing to strong i love grape flavored candy soda and these are pretty good there is another company that makes grape gummy bears that are a little bit better in my opinion but these are well worth it for the price i like to use the gummy bears in home made popsicles with flavored sports drink the salt in the sports drink makes for softer popsicles and the gummy bears are awesome frozen they are delicious i ordered two of these and two of raspberry latice tarts directly from fantasicakes website for a dinner party i was hosting it arrived fresh and intact very good size i froze half for later use i am a pastry lover and these were the best ive ever tasted the pastry was soft the jam was really good and the taste was great they were gone in no time my guests were really impressed buyer beware please this sweetener is not for everybody maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body you will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who can not digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience nausea diarrhea headaches can also be experienced i learned my lesson the hard way years ago when i fell in love with the sugarfree chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell i thought id found sugarfree chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in the discomfort was unlike anything i had ever felt before i blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping as the symptoms passed this too was very unpleasant though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit all symptoms were gone when i stopped eating the chocolate my hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when i purchased some delicious sugarfree popcorn at my local market the taste was amazing and while i was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy new sugarfree treat taste so good my heart sank when i followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener down to the very bottom of the label and read maltitol in tiny little letters thank goodness id eaten only a little i still ended up with all the same sideeffects but for a much shorter duration some people can use maltitol to their hearts content but others like me can have a bad reaction to it in case youre like me its not you its the maltitol it is okay i would not go out of my way to buy it again no tea flavor at all just whole brunch of artifial flavors it is not returnable i wasted 20 bucks these looked like a perfect snack to through in with my trail mix unfortunately they arrived in a solid mass of melted chocolate i left them in my pantry for a few days and when i opened them at room temperature they were still gooey i through them in the fridge and ive been breaking off hunks ever since they taste good to me but the chocolate is all grainy after melting and then solidifying again i wont order them online again but if i see them in a store i would pick them up these taste really good i have been purchasing a different brand and these are very similar in taste and texture i agree with the other reviewer regarding ordering in the summer there is no insulating packaging with ice packs so they will melt in warm weather like all chocolate food items order in cold weather and buy enough to last the taste was great but the berries had melted may order again in winter if you order in cold weather you should enjoy flavor i know i can not make tea this good granted i am not from the south but i know i have never enjoyed tea that was this sweet without being too sweet it tastes crisp this peppermint stick is delicious and fun to eat my dad got me one for christmas because he remembered me having a similar one when i was a little girl im 30 now and i love it great gift for all ages i purchased these giant canes before and the recipients loved them so much they kept them and would not eat them i know the product title says molecular gastronomy but dont let that scare you off i have been looking for this for a while now not for food science but for something more down to earth i use it to make my own coffee creamer br br i have to have my coffee blonde and sweet but the flavored creamers are full of the bad kinds of fat and honestly i hate to use manufactured food items i really dont think they are good for the body on the other hand i hate using cold milk or cream because i like hot coffee br br i stumbled across this on amazon one day and got the idea of making my own creamer i also bought lowfat noninstant milk powder and regular milk powder the noninstant lowfat milk is a little sweeter and tastes fresher than regular instant lowfat milk but does not dissolve good in cold water which is not a problem for hot coffee you will have to play with the ratios i would not do just the heavy cream it made the coffee too rich also i think the powder is too expensive to just use on its own i like mixing 13 of each together br br for flavoring i bough cocoa bean powder vanilla bean powder and caster superfine sugar i mix up small batches along with spices like cinnamon and nutmeg to make my own flavored creamers if you wanted you could use a fake sweetner powder instead i make up small amounts that i store in jelly canning jars i also use my little food chopper food processor to blend everything so the sugar is not heavier and sinks to the bottom let it settle for a bit before opening the top though br br this stuff tastes way better than the storebought creamers and it is fun to experiment and come up with your own flavors i am going to try using some essential oils next and see if i can get a good chocolate orange mix br br all of the ingredients i mentioned are here online take the time to experiment maybe you dont use any lowfat milk or dont add any flavorings it is up to you also would make great housewarming host ess gifts br br i am sure other molecular people will be able to tell you more of what you can do with it and i am sure i will experiment with it in cooking but the main reason i bought it was to make my own creamer and it worked out great while my dogs like all of the flavors that we have tried of this dog food for some reason their itching increased when i tried the lamb and rice i have some very itchy dogs and am giving them a limited ingredient dog food to try to help the duck and sweet potato cut down on the itching significantly but when we tried lamb and rice they started itching more once again i like natural balance for the quality ingredients awesome dog food however when given to my boston who has severe reactions to some food ingredients his itching increased to violent jumping out of bed at night scratching as soon as i changed to a different formula the scratching stopped so glad natural balance has other choices i guess you have to try each until you find whats best for your pet we have three dogs and all of them love this food we bought it specifically for one of our dogs who has food allergies and it works great for him no more hot spots or tummy problems br i love that it ships right to our door with free shipping my dog has a ton of allergies both environmental and food she was on a prescription dog food before we had her tested to see what allergies she has after we got the test back we learned she was allergic to something in the prescription brand so i finally found this dog food and she has done so well on this she still has her environmental triggers but i am happy she can finally eat something i know wont cause her pain my shepherd collie mix has ibs our vet recommended a limited ingredient food this has really helped her symptoms and she likes it i will always buy it from amazon its 10 cheaper and free shipping natural balance dry dog food lamb meal and brown rice recipe did wonders for my jack russell she has awful food allergys and this food was our last hope because it was the last food we could find that didnt have something in it that she was allergic to she has no problem eating it dry but normally i mix the natural balance dry lamb and brown rice with the natural balance wet lamb and brown rice she seems to like that better we started feeding it to our other dog a bichon too and she loves it if your dog has allergys or stomach issue or if you want your dog to eat better food this is it you will see a difference in your pet great food i love the idea of one food for all ages breeds ã  ts a real convenience as well as a really good product my 3 dogs eat less have almost no gas their poop is regular and a perfect consistency what else can a mom ask for i have a standard poodle and pomeranian who both do wonderful on this food i have switched them to a different food due to price a couple of times and end up going right back to natural balance this is great dog food my dog has severs allergies and this brand is the only one that we can feed him this food is great all ages dogs i have a 3 year old and a puppy they are both so soft and hardly ever get sick the food is good especially when you have amazon prime shipping my golden retriever is one of the most picky dogs ive ever met after experimenting with various types of food i have found she loves natural balance what i really like about natural balance is the fact that it has multiple flavors in dry and wet varieties i mix her dry food with a little wet food and my golden loves it furthermore i do like mixing up the flavors each time as i think the same meal day over day might get a little boring so i figured why not i tend to stay away from the fish type though as it smells br br additionally i started purchasing off amazon because petco didnt have the wet food box and only had a couple of cans i came home and to my surprise realized that i could save 20 each time i bought dog food if i just buy it off amazon br br all in all i definitely recommend and give my stamp of approval to natural balance dog food while i have never eaten it my dog seems to love it this is the same food we get at pet store but its delivered to my door and for the same price or slightly less ive been very pleased with the natural balance dog food our dogs have had issues with other dog foods in the past and i had someone recommend natural balance grain free since it is possible they were allergic to grains since switching i havent had any issues it is also helpful that have have different kibble size for larger smaller sized dogs my 11 2 year old basenji jack russell mix loves this dog food hes been noticeably healthier and more energetic since i switched him over from the standard dog foods earlier this year despite the higher cost of natural dog foods i find that he eats significantly less of the natural balance dog foods and still stays happy and full on the normal dog foods hed eat up to 3 cups of dog food a day the recommended serving for his size whereas he only eats about 1 cup to 11 2 cup of the natural balance dog food a day when you take this into account youre actually getting more bang for your buck with the natural dog foods since you dont have to buy as much to last just as long as the normal dog foods and a healthier happier dog to boot add in the fact that you can get free 2 day shipping with amazon prime im sold our pup has experienced allergies in forms of hotspots and itching from other dog foods the cheap you can buy it anywhere food not only have crazy preservatives in them but can cause health problems for your pets this food works wonders on reducing allergies and our dog loves the food br this message is ramsey frankenstein approved my english bulldog had skin allergies the summer we got him at age 3 the vet recommended we wean him off the food his previous owner gave him iams lamb and rice and onto a new kind this was the second one we tried and it has been working ever since its for dogs that need a limited diet who can be sensitive to additives and proteins commonly found in commercial dog food like chicken or beef i fed this to my golden retriever and he hated it he wouldnt eat it and when he did it gave him terrible diarrhea we will not be buying this again its also super expensive the mouth says how do i love thee let me count the ways br if you like apple products a must have item the only draw back shipping cost these are very heavy arrived slightly thawed my parents wouldnt accept it however the company was very helpful and issued a full refund the crust on these tarts are perfect my husband loves these but im not so crazy about them they are just too sour tart for my taste ill eat the crust and hubby takes my filling my kids think theyre great so maybe its just me these are absolutely scrumptuous my husband and i both love them however as another customer put it they are expensive to ship the cost of shipping is more than the tartlets themselves are what a nice alternative to an apple pie love the fact there was no slicing and dicing easy to prepare i also loved the fact that you can make them fresh whenever needed i like creme brulee i loved that these were so easy just sprinkle on the sugar that came with and broil they look amazing and taste great my guess thought i really went out of the way for them when really it took all of 5 minutes i will be ordering more not what i was expecting in terms of the companys reputation for excellent home delivery products i first bought pickled asparagus at an amish market and it was love at first bite hence when i saw these on the discount rack at the local safeway i cleaned it out these are even better than the ones from the amish market they are fantastic and some of the jars have a bonus clove of garlic at the bottom im going to order the six pack and im a household of one they wont go to waste i love asparagus up until very recently i had never had pickled asparagus oh my goodness when a friend introduced me to this exact brand i couldnt believe how great stuff tasted i loved it so much i bought the six pack ive got 2 jars left gon na need more im presently on a diet and i was at my fresh and easy neighborhood grocery looking over possible diet foods i wanted things that were tasty nonfat and low in calories i came home with about a dozen items thats how i discovered the tillen farms pickled crispy asparagus well ive always liked asparagus anyway and ive enjoyed several brands of pickled asparagus this tillen farms brand is really really good its the best i can recall theres an excellent flavor and a big clove of garlic down in the bottom of the jar which im looking forward to eating i cant believe how good this asparagus tastes and right on the front it says only 60 calories per jar now this is my idea of a good diet food br br gary peterson i was diappointed in the flavor and texture of this mix i usually like most of the low carb things i have tried but was diappointed in this specific one i have been drinking this tea for a long time now i used to have to purchase it at a doctors office because it wasnt available elsewhere im so glad that i can buy it now from amazoncom i drink this tea throughout the day like other folks drink coffee wonderful taste i have been drinking royal king 100 natural organic green tea 100 tea bags x 2g each as my every day tea for several years now i buy 12 boxes at a time to save on shipping for many years i used to drink coffee from morning till night but finally i realized that drinking so much coffee was not healthy for me i finally resolved to improve my health and stopped drinking coffee all together i tried many alternative drinks to replace my coffee habit i found that green tea was not only good tasting it also has health benefits green tea is one of the few drinks that actually makes you healthier coffe and other drinks do not the only healthier drink is quality cold water in my opinion for the price royal king 100 natural organic green tea is one of the best tasting teas this green tea has a beautiful golden color the taste is bright and fresh i recommend adding a tiny amount of y s organic bee farms raw honey to the tea to add sweetness and health benefits too i also give myself a treat once in a while by having a much more expense tea tribute xi hu long jing but this fantastic tea is not practical for me to drink as my every day tea although i would if i could afford it br br cons on my latest shipment the package shown on the amazon page is different than the one shipped the one shipped displays naturally high in polyphenol catechins a key contributive element to the possible health effects of tea whereas the amazon package displays caffene free so i am not sure if this green tea is caffene free or not the other con is that sometimes the tea bag rips open when i unwrap the string from around the tea bag so if the string seems stuck to the tea bag i put the bag in the hot water to unstick it this has to be one of the best teas i have ever tasted its clean bright fresh br br great delivery again quality just try it i love love this green tea it is very hard to find in our area and some places on the internet charge a big price and i usually dont get as many boxes as i did with this merchant i will definitely order from this seller again thanks i depend on my green tea fix everyday i love this tea it helps curb my eating during the day my mom and i have given it all friends to try im italian and i lived in italy for years i used to buy these cookies for my everyday breakfast with an italian espresso i couldnt find them anywhere here in the bay area so its great to have them again in the 1980s i spent several summers in italy this biscotti is often given as a breakfast food or midday snack they are simple and delicious and were not sold in the us back then they are so good that i brought back two bags from a recent trip to italy it is great to see that they may now be found on amazon br br note it is great to open a bag smell the contents pour a glass of milk then dip the macines in the milk great routine and treat for kids i had heard a little about this product from the local pet store then tried a small bag for our 2 cats of about 3 and 6 years respectively the female younger one took to it right away and the older male who was unfortunately weaned on the junk cat food with all the corn meal and etc in it and would usually refuse a diet change actually liked it too the older male is overweight and we were trying to switch him to soft food on the doctors request but he totally refused it he is a posh cat after all he still consumes too many calories the fatty but at least i know hes eating good food of course i know this product seems to cost more than most other feline food on the market but i just cant see feeding our animals the lousy alternatives that are out there marketed as being healthy why do commercials show cats eating a vegetarian diet which is mostly corn meal is that right ill stay with this for now but stay tuned br br im updating this review after 9 months of using this cat food for our two cats i upgraded the stars from 4 to 5 as it really has been a good food for the two of them garfield still eats a little too much but hes just a big cat who doesnt exercise much lets face it our female cat will be 4 years old in a couple months and shes so healthy shes tiny but happy and agile i tried the chicken version of holistic select but garfield seemd to miss this sardine version so we went back to this one ive ordered the duck version and will update this once they try it i started buying this after i noticed my 1 year old cat was already starting to lose his spunk so i decided it was time to start buying him real cat food not the garbage in the super markets i found this at the pet store out of the other million choices and im sure there are other brands that are just as good but this is the one i went with to try first and it was a great purchase my cat has been on this for the past 8 months and hes now just has active as he was when he was a kitten and his coat has became sooo soft mainly he loved the taste even more i highly recommend this brand to all my friends and family for their animals i have done a lot of research to find the best food for my cat and this is an excellent food that is also according to my holistic veterinarian they put probiotics on the kibble as the last step which is very important to me the best thing is that my cat loved it immediately and i had to stop mixing it with the old food because she only would eat holistic select this cat food was recommended by my vet because my 13 year old cleo cat was having trouble keeping any food down and was loosing weight it stopped her problems she doesnt eat as much as before since she seems to be more satisfied after eating which helps justify the added price it aids in digestion since the ok sorry smells are gone if ya know what i mean had to add that so anyone experiencing problems with their cats can see there are a lot of benifits from this cat food i have a 4 year old male cat who has chronic urinary tract infections i feed him this dry food in combination with wet food with water added to it and uri ease the combination seems to keeps his utis under control if i switch to another type of dry food his uti gets worse the other cats seem to enjoy this food as well its expensive but it seems to be the best solution for me before i was educated about feline nutrition i allowed my cats to become addicted to dry cat food i always offered both canned and dry but wish i would have fed them premium quality canned food and limited dry food i have two 15 year old cats and two 5 year old cats the only good quality dry foods they will eat are wellness and innova innovas manufacturer was recently purchased by procter gamble i began looking for a replacement after once again offering several samples from my local holistic pet store holistic select was the only one other than the usual wellness and innova they would eat for finicky cats i recommend trying holistic select it is a good quality food that is very palatable for finicky eaters my holistic vet recommended this along with a few other brands we tried them all but my cats prefer this especially the sardine version the best part is their coats are so soft and clean and their eyes are so clear and and i dont want to be rude so ill say this as delicately as i can their waste is far less odorous than cats who eat the mcdonalds junk found in most stores which is a definite plus for me the health benefits are so obvious i highly recommend holistic select one of my cats is allergic to fish and beef this formula is one of the few she can eat and it has much better ingredients than the prescription diets available at the vet both of my kitties are very active have soft shiny fur and neither are fat dry food reduces tartar buildup on teeth also our cats thrive extremely well on this dry cat food they definitely have much less hair ball throw ups and their fur is great they are fit and not over weight this vendor ships extremely fast is one of the top amazon suppliers in our book ive been a fan of hot spicy maruchan ramen for a long time if you enjoy spice and love ramen youll love this product too bad its way too expensive here on amazon its only 336 per 12 at my walmart ive been eating ramen noodles since i was a little kid and ive never found a better flavor than hot spicy chicken it isnt hot at all to a chilihead like me but it sure is good i love spicy ramen but for whatever reasons this thing burns my stomach badly and the burning sensation doesnt go away for like 3 hours not sure if that is healthy or not and you can buy this at walmart for 028 way cheaper than amazon always being a fan of ramen as a quick and easy meal finding it on amazon for a decent price and having it delivered to your door by the case is an amazing situation for anyone to find themselves in i must be a bit of a wuss because this soup tastes to me how i imagine fire might taste typically i like spicy food if it has a good flavor i dont find this to be the case with this soup any flavor is killed off by the burn i really loved the spicy flavor these had i found myself liking the broth more than the noodles which is usually the opposite if you arent used to the heat this might bother you and if you like hot hot foods this might not be enough got these on sale for roughly 25 cents per cup which is half the price of my local grocery stores plus they rarely stock the spicy flavors these things are a great snack for my office where time is constantly crunched and sometimes you cant escape for a real meal this is one of my favorite flavors of instant lunch and will be back to buy every time it goes on sale i have bought allot of different flavors and this happens to be one of my favorites and will be getting more soon i love this flavor of ramen i dont eat other flavors anymore because they taste too bland by comparison for the convenience of having it delivered to my home i have prime so i get it in two days and dont have to pay for the shipping the price on amazon isnt bad at all but it is still cheaper to run down and pick up a case of this at the grocery store the best investment ive ever made for ginger its unbelievable its fibrous like the real ginger has that spicy kick to it but its perfect with the sugar calms it down its very worth the 40 for 5lbs of it ill be getting more soon i use these as a topper for my ginger cupcakes and cookies delicious i can not get australian ginger where i live this compares favorably to australian ginger ive purchased in other cities now i can enjoy it without traveling i keep trying other brands cheaper brands stupid me this ginger is soooo worth the money tender moist and never a let down my son has had acid reflux since birth and has been on every medication available with no improvement until an older gentleman came into his work place and told him about this product and i automatically ordered it for him i was really not expecting any better results than the 1000 other things we have tried what a surprise he has not had any heartburn or symptoms since day 2 of starting eating one piece of this ginger each morning he can now eat anything and actually enjoy it this product was a god send for him thank you all for it i bought this for our office to give people something sweet to snack on because its bite size its easier for people to grab a couple a pieces rather than an entire licorice stick my only complaint is that one of the bags broke open in shipping twizzlers brand licorice is much better than that other well known brand br if you can get these for 2 to 250 a package with free s h its a good deal br the black and cherry have good taste but the strawberry taste was too delicate and barely there i love these very tasty infact i think i am addicted to them br buying them in packs of 6 bags is very reasonable than going to target and getting a bag savings are about a 100 a bag i use subscribe and save on these and several other product i love subscribe and save if you are looking for a less messy version of licorice for the children then be sure to try these theyre soft easy to chew and they dont get your hands all sticky and gross in the car in the summer at the beach etc we love all the flavos and sometimes mix these in with the chocolate to have a very nice snack great item great price too highly recommend i might be mistaken but it appears that the pieces in this bag were reduced in size if they did do that it was doubtlessly done to make it appear that the buyer got a better deal having so many pieces after all the problem is that the pieces have to be a certain size in order to have enough flavor for your eating experience as it is you have to use 2 or 3 pieces to match the old piece size it is not the same being a fan of newmans pineapple salsa for quite a while i was looking for a comparable salsa this is one of the best tasting salsas ive ever had my daughters love it too they dont like super chunky salsa and the berry mango has a nice smooth texture with small mango pieces the salsa is not too sweet just sweet enough and although its mild it has a nice little kick to it at this price its a steal the salsa smelled delicious as i think it probably was but unfortunately the person at amazon that is a packer there is probably several had very little stuffing to work with especially on the bottoms therefore the bottoms were broken on all three bottles as i reached for my computer i was told no returns cause its a food item i then looked for a customer service tag and i found none on their new face lift they seem to be proud of their new face lift but they should at least have a place to contact them in emergencies like i buy a lot of stuff and it all comes in styrofoam boxes never would i ship things br especially salsa in a cardboard box with just a stripe of large bubble wrap on it no matter how much the carrier fed ex is careful its going to break somewhere along the line especially in an all glass container barbara l s this is one of the best salsas that i have found in a long time but stay away from the variety pack the other two that come with it are not worth your money these remind me of dog treats i made once using pumpkin and cinnamon theyre kind of bland and not my favorite back to nature product but my finace really loves them so thats where the three stars come from this is the best cornmeal i made regular cornbread and hot water cornbread with this meal and both were outstanding also fried some oysters with this meal it gave them a great texture and flovor this is a fabulous marinade i love to use it for chicken either baked in the oven or on the grill this has enough flavor flair ive even used it for dinner parties only to receive rave reviews from my guests definitely worth the price super cheap and super easy love it works with chicken fish beef or pork fast easy and makes it taste excellent plus buying in bulk is more than 50 off from box stores got this for my brother who is on jorge cruise diet and decided to try one for myself it actually tastes pretty good these singles sell for 250 336 at the store for 1 box of 24 singles im not sure why amazon is selling it for 999 for a box of 24 singles hazelnut coffee creamer is my favorite but truly this is not a good buy awesome such a yummy flavor i got it as a healthy alternative to the desserts we normally eat and i am so glad that i did there are so many things you can do with jello desserts and still have them taste good and be good for you i will definitentally be purchasing this product again the flavor was so wonderful i went to 4 grocery stores looking for this flavor of jello for my green tomato jam recipe and finally found it here this jello is wonderful evidently its only carried in the stores during the summer but with harvest time in the fall i couldnt find it anywhere in town this jello tastes like watermelon and the jam recipe i made with it takes like watermelon jam great made as regular jello too yummy what a deal this is the healthiest salt you can use this box should last our family the year no problem iodized sea salt will not raise your blood pressure as regular salt will perfect size sea salt for the table or the picnic basket we love it shakes well no clumping and flows freely span class tiny length 026 mins br br span the expiration date is 21 months from the day i bought this product the tuna tomato combination is delicious this is one of the many items i reorder on amazon every month or so br edit added a short video so you see what this combination looks like br br i was wearing one of those headlamps but i didnt do a good job focusing on the tuna br i should film it over but it doesnt look like many people view this product anyway ive never heard of the safcol brand before but i was tired of only trying the typical pouches starkist and chicken of the sea i was really surprised as i thought it was a bit better than the other brands and with less seasoning these are the best tasting tuna pack they make in my opinion make a great on the go snack and really satisfying with the tomato i have always purchased starkist tuna but thought i would try this brand for a change of pace the taste of the tuna was not pleasant too much basil and other spices for me im not familiar with the safcol brand but being a tuna addict gave this a shot the tuna tastes like its good quality but i found the tomato basil flavor to be a bit bland its better than something plain but it didnt pack the punch i was hoping for its still a great option for a low calorie low fat meal i found it much tastier than the plain tuna pouches out there excellent quality and no need to dress it up br br i put it the micro on about 20 power for 1 minute and shazam br br i believe a little heating brings out the flavor seriously this product was as tasteless as they come there are much better tasting products out there but at 100 calories its better than a special k bar or cookie snack pack you just have to season it or combine it with something else to share the flavor i read about pomegranate molasses so i had to try it i havent made anything with it yet just eaten a little bit at a time but wow is it decadent its dark syrupy sour and a little sweet a dab of this and i forget about dessert its just a really unique flavor with a pleasing metallic undertone yum im going to try making fesenjan next used this in moroccan recipes as a syrup in a brilliant mixed beverage and as a swirled topping on sliced oranges soaked in orange water wonderful wonderful stuff i dont know how long these sat on the back of a shelf somewhere but they were so old that they wouldnt cook i had to throw half of them out because the skins were damaged a clear sign of dried beans past their prime i cant even return these or ask for a refund because food is not returnable will find a different brand to use for now i have about fifty servings of beans to throw away besides being smaller than runts they look the same and have the same consistency unfortunately they taste nothing like banana runts nor do they even taste good yucky stuff trying to return with vendor the item over all was fine but the banana heads are not just like banana runts they are alot smaller also when i received the item the packaging was not great the banana heads had come open during shipping and were all over the packing envelope i purchased as a giveaway for a baby shower with jungle theme they worked out perfect for 25 small bags of candy i purchased 5 if you want more than 25 small bags i would purchase a larger bag i have drunk ricore since my mother allowed be to drink caffeine i love this stuff in milk br its much smoother and tastier than instant coffee with milk i am french and live in the us br and bring back boxes of ricore at every opportunity savora is another hidden gem you can bring br back check it out i first had this drink when my mother brought it back with her from a visit to her home in brittany france and thought it was delicious i wish it were a bit cheaper but other than that i love this product i couldnt wait to try the 8 ″ cinnamon coffee cake because it is made with fresh eggs creamy sour cream madagascar bourbon vanilla and is topped and filled with cinnamon streusel this 8 ″ cinnamon coffee cake is available online for only 1895 now i have had my fair share of cinnamon coffee cakes but let me just tell you that the fantasicakes cinnamon coffee cake really takes the cake with size price quality and taste br the cake arrived very fast and was carefully packaged so that it arrived in almost perfect condition it also comes with a large tub of white icing that you can drizzle over the top before serving i couldnt believe how large the size was and it actually fed my family of 5 for us to enjoy during breakfast for three days the cake itself is thick and almost has a solid but sponge cake type consistency that is really moist and very filling the flavors are to die for with the sticky cinnamon outside and sweet cinnamon and vanilla swirled throughout the inside of the cake the icing really tops it off beautifully and gives it that moist and sticky sweet flavor pair the cake with your morning coffee and youve got the perfect breakfast treat i used to love these growing up and stopped drinking water and lemon juice from this brand about 56 years ago this stuff used to be so strong i used to just pour some in my mouth and get that alive feeling going it feels like the product went through changes which added more water or something to make it not so strong the stronger it is the less you use as well the product is still really good but the taste is the same quality as the cheaper brand names almost i thought these would go fast but hey all lemon stuff i love unless it goes bad this is a good product just wish it still had that hit me in the mouth chug sensation it used to be like one of the best lemon juice that i have tried i am recurring customer due to the high quality of this product when the season for fresh lemos is out this one supplement our need for the citrus on the kitchen or refreshments br br i will continue buying it this lemon juice is a must in my kitchen yearround it has a powerful flavor and you dont need much of it to zest up a dish i add a spritz of it to my water nearly every day br br i will buy this product again and again fast delivery and good product this is the same lemon juice concentrate you can find in stores and its really handy to have around to add to sauces dressings etc such a pain to squeeze fresh juice everytime you need it nevermind having the lemons on hand to begin with this is not as good as the frozen lemon juice but it is good it has a slightly odd flavor perhaps from a preservative sure wish i could order the frozen juice couldnt believe it when told how relaxing this beverage was seriously drink it only if you are getting ready for a nap or bedtime if you have plans to drive or perform any other activity not recommended br br i feel my arms and legs almost tingle with relaxation after a short time my eyes start to get droopy and i am in another place br br love this stuff i bought these at grocery outlet here in the seattle tacoma are for 400 a case of tweleve not paying 3800 yes 3 for a dollar i like the taste not great but not bad either low calorie will buy more but not at this whacked out price this is an great product the taste is great and it works exactly as described superb natural sleep aid amazing we have been looking for natural ways to help us sleep since we always seem to be overloaded with stress and a busy schedule yes wed probably be better served taking a yoga class but this is a good second choice this helps you fall asleep and stay asleep i drank half the first night and that was plenty for me after about 30 minutes i was ready for bed i woke up refreshed and with no sleepydrug hangover so that is a huge bonus br br i gave the product 3 stars instead of the 5 it deserves as their packing job was marginal at best the product arrived with 2 broken bottles which at this price is a 6 loss the bottles are glass and all they did was wrap one layer of the smallbubbled bubble wrap around the case and placed it in a larger box with extra room to move around in that box big packing fail but the product is awesome we made chocolate chip cookies with brm garbanzo bean flour and the results were fantastic the brown sugar and chocolate mask any bean taste that other reviews have mentioned our friends couldnt discern any difference from classic cccs the texture body and elasticity meaning reduced tendency to fall apart that occurs with most other glutenfree flours is nice and chewy the same as cccs made with regular flour and an added bonus the high protein and fiber level i calculate 23 g fiber cookie fills you up so that you are satisfied with smaller servings and the glycemic index is significantly lower br br i highly recommend this flour even if cccs are the only thing you make with it this is great stuff made some really tasty banana bread good quality and lowest price in town we had trouble finding this locally delivery was fast no more hunting up and down the flour aisle at our local grocery stores this packet of glaze is the secret to making those european style fresh fruit tarts i am about to make one for a pie auction at church after a friend requested that something strawberry should be offered you can make the most amazing and relatively healthy fruit tarts by baking a base layering it with uncooked fresh sliced fruit then pouring over the madeup contents of one of these packets they harden up at room temperature hold the fruit together so you can slice the tart and they let the beauty of the arranged fruit show through ive also seen this glaze used over cheesecakes to hold a fruit topping in place personally i do not like cheesecake too rich for me but a fruit glazed cheesecake is gorgeous i will admit to do this slice fruit and layer it on the cheesecake while its still in the springform pan pour on the glaze let it set up and then remove the springform youll have a clear layer of fruit on top of the cheesecake cherries strawberries or sliced mangos are nice but the best one i ever had used thin slices of lemons that had been gently poached in sugar syrup before they were layered on the cake br br i use a base of sponge cake baked in a shallow form but other bases can be pate sucre a kind of french pastry that is a bit like a sugar cookie that works well in those fluted straightsided forms you can also make minitarts in a muffin pan prebaking each mold with a layer of pie crust even commercial crust works though again i prefer pate sucre it holds its shape better and is more substantial and has a better crumb just blindbake the muffin tins lined with pate then pop them out and fill with fresh fruits berries are great and pour over the glaze some people put a layer of creme patisserie which is a pastry cream like custard but stabilized with flour below the fruit and i happen to think these taste best br br if you get into baking this glaze is a musthave on the shelf the ingredients are vegan tapioca starch carrageenan dextrose cream of tartar locust bean gum so if you are looking to make a vegan tofu cheesecake you can use this on top as well as use it for fruit tarts with a nut crust base my scotties were full of hot spots and when i used this within a week all the hot spots were gone the smell is kinda strong but not bad its tolerablel i bought this coffee because its much cheaper than the ganocafe and has the organic reishi mushroom as well as other healthy antioxidants i didnt expect it to taste good but it actually does ive only had it for a few days and for 5 its totally worth it my sisters all take ganocafe but now im introducing them to this less expensive similar coffee i will follow up on this product in a few weeks the coffee is very finely processed and the flavor is just alright nescafe and mount hagen are better i bought this to try something other than these two but i probably wont get this again there is just a slight vitaminy taste but its not overwhelming its also a bit pricey for what you get this coffee is great because its all organic ingredients no pesticides to worry about plus it tastes good and you have the healing effects for ganoderma like the other people mentioned this coffee has a great taste ive tried different instant coffees before but this one is one of the better ones another one of my favorites if you want to try it out though not organic is africafe pure instant coffee tastes great and gives me energy without the jitters love this product br however i do wish it came in some sort of resealable jar or hard plastic container instead of a ziplock pouch because the ziplock ripped off and quit working after awhile but the product is fantastic just not crazy about the packaging these little guys are tasty and refreshing br br i usually eat salads for lunch which can do terrible things to breath i eat 2 of these after lunch because they are so small and i find this sufficiently resolves the problem br br theyre sugar free sugar can actually help the smelly bacteria grow which is great and theyre tasty enough that i almost think of them as part of my lunch br br this is a good bulk value buy and id highly recommend the mints themselves cheers i like these better than the regular altoids but theyre even more costly so youd better like them these little tins of sugar free mine mints were a great dealthere perfict for on the gofifty mints per tin is just the right amount to cary alongand there safer for your teeth than the ones with sugarthe price of twelve dollars was very resonablealso there great for shareingif you are looking for a mint try these onesyoull be glad you did pros br packaging shipping price br sold about a year before its expiration date enough for me to eat share 9 boxes br not too fresh like the regular wintergreen and not in a powdery form its a real mint br br cons none be careful not to eat too many of them in one day as one of the chemicals in it is the same as that of a laxative lololol these mints are really strong and have a great taste they are also a convenient size to carry in a pocket or purse this is a huge supply of them im still working on these and have plenty to spare much more effective than buying one from the grocery store or 711 every time you want a mint even with small containers they dont fill them up these little tins are less than half filled and at the price charged it seems a ripoff is there some exotic ingredient as costly as gold contained in those tiny squares or how about the cereal ploy they were filled at the factory but settled in transport br can manufacturers be honest in their dealings i love and use the empty containers for medicine advil in my purse desk suitcase also line with felt to keep earrings perfect little size to disguise small valuables when traveling and love the mints tiny and powerful without burning my mouth received as shown my mother in law likes these and walgreens quit carrying them it was great i could get them on amazon i keep a case of these in my office and always have at least a tin or two on my desk for visitors to help themselves to some folks stop by just to grab some mints and others pop them like candy while we meet when i find someone who keeps coming back for more i just give them their own tin one coworker asked me to save the tins for her so she could use them as pillboxes and safety pin boxes like i said theyre a real hit since i wouldnt be able to keep my hands off a candy dish this is a good alternative to have around and its nice to have them around if i have garlic for lunch i gave the item 4 stars because they arent as tasty as the sugar version of the mints but what sugar free item is as good as its full sugar counterpart and because of the fact that each tin is wrapped in plastic which seems like a waste and is irritating to remove although i totally get why they wrap it it still doesnt make it easy to deal with the tiny altoids are great for a quick breath freshening and the small box is great for portability its full but compact br br i havent run out yet and probably wont for a couple months but i cant wait to buy it again i loved these wintergreen altoid smalls so much i had to come write a review the packaging is small for convenience and the altoids are smaller as well with a square shape blue hue and even more delicious taste in my opinion i definitely prefer them over the regularsize altoids and will continue purchasing them highly recommended fresh scent and taste easy to eat one tin in few hours i use them as favors and everyone loved them hard to find the wintergreen smalls sugar free as stores only have the red smalls peppermint such a common flavor the wintergreen is refreshing and absolutely delicious driving cross country if someone cuts me off i turn to my daughter with my hand out and say wintergreen me she pulls one out puts it in my hand and all is right with the world to me these are nothing like the regular altoids and are not breath mints they are pleasanttasting little candies in a cute convenient tin and thats as far as it goes the mintiness is just not strong and the wintergreens are definitely weaker than the peppermint minis im not a dragonbreath person but still one of these mints is too small to have any effect on my breath four or five will freshen my breath for a short while maybe 15 minutes at this point i think the icebreakers frost mints are the best as sugar free breath mints we have fed our cats a lot of stuff these 2 boy cats are not picky eaters they loved the purina they loved the nutro they loved the iams they love whatever we feed them br br this review is based on what we their affectionate owners love after a certain age we were instructed by the vet to consider senior foods and lower carb foods because the catties were fatties we tried a few types of food some evinced no change some made the litter superstink some had too small a kibble and the cats barfed it up because they didnt have to chew it to swallow it br br this felidae has done the trick no problems to speak of it is consistent in the litter and bearable on the nose the cats love it the kibble is sized appropriate to chewing and heres the kicker br after feeding the cats felidae their demeanor improved their coats are super soft and lush both are new improvements we can directly attribute to this food were now loyal felidae consumers br br additionally the absence of corn product in the feed seems to lessen or remove the reactions of our friends with catallergies i started my cat on felidae platinum about 3 weeks ago and she loves it shes an older cat somewhat overweight and had a grouchy temperament i first mixed it with her previous food and she figured out which was which she ate the felidae and left the old food shes now been on just the felidae for about ten days now off the old food entirely and she is a much sweeter happier cat i think it must agree with her better or be more easily digested or something in any case i am a happy purchaser of felidae i dont agree with the previous reviewer that cats dont like it clearly mine does we have three cats the youngest is about eleven years old another is fifteen and our oldest is well ancient that is what the vet told us ten years ago the youngest is a blob when he lays down he looks like a footstool the other two are arthritic and skinny br br since we had such success with canidae platinum for senior dogs i figured that wed give it a try for our cats id had them on low ash purina one urinary tract formula for their entire lives and thankfully we had no ut problems br br buster the youngest is still a blob after six months plus on felidae for senior and overweight cats however the other two are now much more active and we can tell that they are really feeling better since we changed their food to felidae even prissy the ancient one has started to play and tease the dogs by getting them to chase her where before when she was on purina one all she wanted to do was to sleep br br i think that if you can get your cat on this fairly early in their weight problems itll be more effective br br however the glucosamine will certainly help your older fur balls have a happier life too much of a good thing we worked this kibble in over time slowly shifting the percentage of felidae to national junkfood brand until the bowl was all natural by this time the cats couldnt keep it in or down what a mess weve moved on as with canidae felidae has also changed their formula cats do not like change when it comes to their food and they just had to change it without putting it on their label we noticed the color of the food had changed and so did the smell as you will notice i have also reviewd the canidae and this all happened the same time the dogs were having issues br br prior to the change in food we had almost lost two of our cats because we had moved to a new home if cats get upset because of a change in enviorment or a loud noise they can stop eating it depends on the cat two of them had stopped eating and had lost a lot of weight we took them to the vet and it took months to get them back to normal it has been a year since then and they are better then the formula for this food changed br br we started to noitce they were not eating as much and it started to bug us we asked the shop owner of the feed store and she had no knowledge of any change to the food it wasnt until the we were in there with other customers yelling about their dogs food making their dogs sick right away we changed the cats food and they started chowing down and havent suffered one bit like our dogs have br br cats are sensitve animals and changes to thier food could cause them to stop eating anyone thinking of purchasing this food should not do it we have 5 rescued and fixed cats none of which are picky eaters and the change in this formula could have been the death of them had we not found out about the change in their formula br br i urge anyone that has had these problems to go to the consumer affairs website and also the fda website and write a letter to them to let them know how this has affected your animal as with canidae they do not care how the change has affected my animals and tell me not to buy it this is just horrible dont buy just a few of these i order these by the case i cant even remember the first time i tasted an anchovy stuffed olive but i have tried several of the brands online and this brand is my favorite i order these olives a lot they are unlike any other olives out there the subtle flavors of the brine go great with cheeses one of my favorite appetizer treats for guests hey the description says 360 grams that is roughly 13 ounces at under 400 per can no way that is the approximate price for a 100 gram can my husband and i are both kind of wimpy when it comes to hot things and this seasoning is just a bit too spicy for us it definitely makes you sweat a bit when youre eating it it was still edible to us by adding a good sized dollop of sour cream but i dont think i would buy it again due to the heat we prefer the milder mccormicks brand of fajita mix ive also had fajitas in a couple of different restaurants and it wasnt as spicy as this mix is br br if you like super spicy then this is not burning hot so you might want to keep that in mind to me it was more than medium hot but not by too much br br i gave it three stars because it was pretty easy to make and its versatile in that you could vary the veggies you put in it you take a plastic bag a couple of tbs of vegetable oil 14 cup water and mix the seasoning water and oil together then add the chicken strips to the bag and let it marinate for 5 minutes in the meantime it says to stir fry your veggies peppers and onion but i found it easier to just cook the chicken and veggies together and i dont think it affected quality or taste i also used extra virgin olive oil rather than vegetable oil br br i have one more package of this to use and next time im going to add more veggies and maybe some chopped tomato to cut the heat a bit more a friend whod been drinking tea for 80 of his 84 years introduced me to this tea a few months ago even took me over to the store and bought me a pound at 7 lb in a retail store or a little over 9 with shipping from an online merchant i think its great ive been drinking earl grey english breakfast irish breakfast lapsang souchong assam etc most of them were over 30 lb with shipping aside from the lapsang souchong i think this is a great replacement for all the rest has everything im looking for in a strong fullbodied black tea with enough character to keep it from becoming boring my current favorite afternoon tea unless youre extremely jaded or a tea snob youll love it i love strong full bodied quality tea and typically drink assam irish breakfast or early grey tea but as the other reviewer noted the price per pound can be discouraging so i have been searching for a quality full bodied tea that wasnt bitter at a more palatable price point and this certainly fits the bill and unlike some other teas where they tend to be better in one form or another i e iced vs hot this tea is excellent in both forms i would certainly recommend this to anyone who prefers that smooth full bodied quality tea that doesnt cost an arm and leg i drink this tea plain without sugar or milk and it has a pleasant aroma br br the price from amazon is cheaper than my local grocery store one reviewer is right i think it has some herbal smell to make up the aroma so the label imperial blend kind of implied the herb br br i am not exactly a black tea drinker so this tea is a surprise and affordable too i usually prefer white chinese tea like white peony but it is more expensive and requires lower temperature water but this is black tea and this aroma kind of remind me the softness of white tea ive tried a variety of ahmad tea not because i particularly like this brand but they are just easier to come across the imperial blend i believe is the most complex yet well balanced of all the ones ive tried its full body like a good cup of assam which by no means overpower the delightful clean taste of darjeerling complete with a long lasting note of bergamot i enjoy it best in the evening it gives a satisfying and relaxing finish to a busy day br br for those interested in the specifics i use about 3 teaspoons of lose tea in a stainless steel infuser in a 16 oz mug let it steep in 208f water for 23 min take the infuser out and drink it without sugar or milk to savor its sophistication i have tried literally dozens of teas since being introduced to the russian custom of preparing and drinking tea and the ahmad imperial blend is probably my favorite of all of these due to the fact that it is equally delicious hot or iced i buy the threepacks as needed from amazon and go through them rapidly my family loves it and my friends have it in their homes now too try one box of it and you will love it too this is an excellent tea one of the best i have ever had it is especially great when you prepare it with a samovar herbal additives in this blend destroy real tea taste it is only for people who like herbal taste i dont makes a tasty super easy meal fast but high in calories br br the instructions say to saute the veggies first but i recommend cooking the chicken first the chicken takes longer to cook and the raw chicken ontop of veggies just makes a slimy mess i made it with snow peas and carrots only i dont like the little corn added some red pepper flakes for heat and served ontop of rice it came out wonderful dinner on the table in less than 30mins i think i have tried just about every bloody mary mixer on the market at one time or the other most have too much sugar or worst corn syrup this mixer is all natural ingredients and very tasty it does have a little kick enjoy might be a little spicy for some but this stuff rocks i use 12 and 12 with v8 for a milder version or the best is a bloody caesar br half mix half clamato took me one or two to get used to the pickle taste but now aim hooked and have to keep a bottle on hand this candy is not as described the middle is almost hard it is not a silky or smooth filling as described br looks and tastes like its way past its expiration date br would never reccommend this paid a good chunk of cash for nothing i started drinking the power slim tea when i was on the hcg diet to help curb cravings since i liked it so well i tried some of the others and i am now hooked they are so satisfying that i drink them all the time the energy gives you that extra pickmeup in the afternoons that helps keep me going all day no matter how long im trying several of the wu yi teas i like this one particularly because of the subtle citrus taste it also has a natural sweetness br br the ingredients include organic wuli cliff oolong tea 700 mg organic black tea 600 mg organic green tea extract 100 mg proprietary blend 600 mg plus some ginseng panax orange peel lemon grass and guarana other ingredients natual orange and citrus flavors br br my goal is to drink more tea and less coffee i am enjoying trying a different kind of tea every day ill be coming back to this one i can not live without this citron falksalt it is wonderful on watermelon fish almost any food requiring salt and in my world it all does just try it on red juicy watermelon wonderful experience terrible artificial lemon taste like pledge lemon furniture polish dont do this to yourself just use plain flake salt and some fresh grated lemon zest these things are huge i love the way the crystals crunch and the flavor is not too overpowering or too subtle this lemony flavor is my favoriteits good on almost everything youll have plenty of flavored salt for a long time if you buy this the taste of these white cheddar flat breads is like a regular cracker which is not bad except that i bought them because i wanted a cheese taste br br what was a huge disappointment how misleading the packaging of the box is the photo on the box i bought these in store makes it look like it is full of long flatbreads expanding the length and width of the box wrong the plastic tray that holds the crackers is about 2 smaller all around leaving you with about 15 or so small flatbreads br br what is also bad about this is that the company states they use biodegradable and ecofriendly packaging fail they used a huge box for a ridiculously small amount of crackers not ecofriendly at all br br would i buy these again no i feel ripped off the other crackers like sesame tarragon give you a little br more bang for your buck and have more flavor this is the ultimate puppy food the kibbles are great for small breeds high in digestible nutrients as opposed to fillers some companies use less waste results from the high quality ingredients i have been hunting training showing and handling various breeds of dogs for nearly 40 years with multiple national champions i have been highly satisfied with eukanubas quality and the results i have obtained feeding their foods my recent purchases are with wag through amazoncom their prices are the best i have found and they are very good at shipping immediately on items in stock the recommendation when we bought our puppies lhasa bichon mix and lhasa poodle mix was that we continue them on the food that they have had since being weaned this is a somewhat expensive food so i cant say that we were terribly pleased but we loaded up on the stuff and headed home br br let me just say this i have had small dogs before never have i seen such gas issues both of them consistently had foul gas consistently usually when theyre sitting on our laps but you know theyre dogs br br when we got through the first bag of this stuff we purchased more on amazon it was a great price for it since we got a 40 lb bag for the price of i think a 15 lb bag at petco but they continued to have gas i mean they loved the food dont get me wrong and they loved it more when wed mix in some water and it would be like soft food somehow that made their gas worse but i think ill have to give that responsible to the speed with which they chowed down cant blame the food itself for gluttony br br eventually we switched their food no more farting i think it was due to the high fat content which undoubtedly is necessary for very small puppies they just need that in their diet i think that we were advised to keep them on it for much longer than was useful they said up until 1 year yeah right you try dealing with gas for that long around 6 mos of age we switched to puppychow much better granted they dont like it as much but we humans like it a whole lot better a very delicate green tea with a smooth light taste and an subtle floral tones and no bitter aftertaste br br in the 20 years we have been drinking ahmad teas not even once have we been disappointed the superb quality of ahmad teas has remained consistent throughout the years br br i am so happy to find ahmad teas available here thanks amazon because only a few stores carry it in my area and they are quite a few miles away the current deal for the pack of 6 is superb much cheaper than i can find locally br br this is a great tasting tea which i am happy to recommend fresh a great way to get a little chocolate in my life without a million calories they taste just like chocolate pudding if you like the ceylon tea variety you will certainly enjoy and appreciate this tea br br i am so happy to find ahmad teas available here thanks amazon and very surprised at the negative review from 2009 because in the 20 years we have been drinking ahmad teas not even once have we been disappointed the superb quality of ahmad teas has remained consistent throughout the years br br the current deal for the pack of 4 is very good cheaper than i can find locally br br highly recommended br br note this listings description is confusing each packet of tea weighs 500 grams which equals 11 pounds or 176 ounces ive been enjoying this tea for years this tea is good mornings afternoons or evenings my local store went out of buisiness thanks amazon i use a bodum tea press to prepare a pot hi i have to have black tea everyday i have done it in the past 25 years and its a habit of mine ahmad tea is one of my favorite brands and i highly recommend it if you like black tea i think this is going to remain my favorite for the next 100 years or so i have tried it out despite the other review and i found that this is exactly the same tea i buy in either russian or italian groceries ahmad tea is an excellent looseleaf tea eith hot or for making iced tea great flavor with no lingering aftertaste ive been drinking this tea for the past 8 or 10 years usually buying a box or two when visiting large metropolitan areas where many middleeastern stores carry loose ahmad teas usually at 57 for a pound box ive always considered it an unremarkable but robust tea with enough aroma and taste and beautiful reddish color perhaps not good enough a tea to drink on its own but a decent base for mixes br this tea however is nothing of the sort freshly opened package has almost no characteristic tea smell and the brewed tea is weak flat and tasteless somehow it just does not seem to be the same product anymore so you get a lot of tea for the money but the quality is such that you might as well drink lipton bags they are not that much worse i love love love this deal its way fun to pick from so many teas and chocolates and ciders as well as many coffees the other outfits that assemble samplers are boring they do the choosing and from a much narrower range the sellers here are very nice also and will answer questions via email about the slightly confusing ordering method its easy if you want great packaging forget it they ship fast and the kups are just tossed loose in a box who cares once youve tried some random sampler packs and now are overloaded with decafs extra bolds or teas this is a great way to get exactly the brands or style that you want received the order in a couple of days and was exactly what i ordered this was my second order and ill be ordering this item again good products and fast shipping equals a happy me a little pricey but you can hand pick a few good flavors a few i cant find anywhere else so def worth the price if used on a daily basis you will keep your gums healty and between your teeth clean and free of plack wow this product is very impressive i bought the 8oz blueberry and was pleased with packaging price and shipping the powder dissolves instantly even in water ive just been mixing a 14 tsp in a small glass of water for now and drinking it down and it tastes great but will add it to my smoothies and juiced fruit juices next this product is so economical compared to purchasing fresh blueberries especially because there is no waste due to mold or overripe berries thrown away i think you could add this to baked or unbaked foods as well im excited to add more of the superfoods to my diet in this fast and easy way i definitely will being trying the other flavors soon the pork chops from omaha steaks were very tasty but at the same time exceptionally dry pork is usually dry meat but these were to the extreme possibly shipping them frozen and keeping them frozen was partly the problem five minutes in one tentacle was bitten off ball inside cracked in half not durable enough to be a dog toy disappointed so is the dog i am chemical sensitive as well as sugarfree i have been using this product for over a year i use it maybe once a week at the most i drink 12 the bottle and then boost my energy after an hour or two depending on how i feel imo this doesnt replace my a m coffee but is sweet in the early afternoon when i start to fade once in a while i drink a full bottle before a workout ive been drinking guayaki yerba mate teas for years compared to the many toxic energy boosters out there i highly recommend this this product is clean and doesnt leave nasty chems behind in the body try it before you judge from a review everyones body reacts differently i felt energized within five minutes but it lasted for about 45 minutes i paid 399 for this drink i could have just drunk a cup of coffee and saved my money yes its probably healthier than 5 hour energy or starbucks shots but if youre looking to avoid a caffeine overload this is still not for you most energy drinks can not be made w out a high dosage of caffeine i believe the caffeine content of 1 guayaki shot is 150 ml probably lower than other unhealthy energy shot drinks but i believe most other people avoid the top brands b c they contain too much caffeine and or sugar if you do not react well to caffeine guayaki is not a good buy either i definitely feel an energy boost w 1 full guayaki shot but not w out all the other caffeine side effects irritability nervousness moodswings caffeine overdose is why i stopped drinking coffee but it looks even organic energy drinks are still not safe br br now youre not sensitive to caffeine then its a great buy its not loaded w sugar the taste is easy and pleasant its not loaded w a bunch of chemicals like 5 hour shots or starbucks drinks and the energy boost lasts for about 4 to 5 hours takes about 5 to 7 minutes to kick in but all this probably depends on your body weight br br side note if you want to feel energized during the day have a protein drink first thing in the morning and stay away for heavy fattening foods during the day that will make you feel sluggish and sleepy these nature valley nut lovers variety pack was perfect although i wasnt sure about the peanut butter bar it was excellent i loved the roasted almond roasted pecan and the peanut butter br br i will definately buy from this seller again quick shipping and very fresh i so wish i would have read this review before purchasing two gallons of this oil for my health issues it reeks like a chemical rubber smell this smell is coming from the black rubber gasket in the lid when i called to report the situation to the company sabrina told me i would have to pay to send them a sample to have tested by a lab unbelievable good customer service would indicate that they would pay for the product to be returned and give me a full refund including shipping the product is faulty period i will never order anything from this company again and do not recommend it to anyone based on this horrible customer service and lack of responsibility and ownership this product has a strong aftertaste of crayola crayons br br i am in the process of trying different brands of coconut oils for cooking purposes upon opening the plastic container the aroma of crayons immediately fills the room and this flavor permeates the food that is cooked in it br br i suspect the source of the problem is the plastic used in the plastic container as i have not experienced this with any of the other brands purchased br br to date my favorite coconut oil is distributed by barleans the flavor is fantastic however they do not supply a gallonsized tub and dr mercola has the best product in that size category had this shipped to my sister who follows a glutenfree eating plan and she reports that it is very versatile and easier than grinding almonds for a crispy crust on chicken and fish filets also uses it in place of bread crumbs in meatloaf and meatballs stays moist when added in place of wheat flour in baking too good product good value these are healthy and my mixed llasa tibetan terrier adores them and they are healthy and his breath doesnt smell and his teeth are in good shape because of such products a great healthy product a great healthy chew for my 9 wk old beagle rio he loves the taste and it sure beats my arm i really enjoy this product i had such a hard time finding it affordable in the store once i found it i look no further its the only sugar i use thanks so much i have used and liked sugar in the raw for many years after being introduced to it in a starbucks my most recent purchase however was disappointing the sugar was lighter in color and had a crystal size maybe 14 th of the regular size having large crystals was something i always really liked about sugar in the raw it enhanced the quality of mixed drinks and of lattes i called their hotline to complain and was told that they had had a problem with their recent sugar crop and that the result was less molasses in the sugar they have had many complaints of a similar nature this they claimed also reduced the crystal size they said this problem should go away with their newer crop the representative said that the newcrop sugar will have a 610 digit date code without any spaces that ends with a 1 and no letters the trailing digits are a date code using the julian calendar my recent badpurchase had a space after the initial sequence of numbers and then ended with a 51a bottom line their current product is not much better than much cheaper products when they get a better crop ill go back to purchasing sugar in the raw sugar in the raw tm please harvest cane w o burning br to be delivered to hc s br dear sugar in the raw folks br br we who buy your product care about the environment and wed like to know that you care too when you burn the cane fields on maui it adds to the co2 and worsens climate change and the smoke from your burning is damaging the lungs of your workers your workers children and the residents of maui br br we love your product and want you to change to noburn harvesting so we can continue to buy it knowing we arent contributing to global warming and lung disease br br love this sugar i also get muscavado sugar and they are both great to use in place of regular white sugar recommend product is exactly as advertised what a savings at least half the retail price easy to store because of the individual packaging i used to buy this sugar for years i do not eat much sugar but still this sugar is called turbinado sugar but is misleading i picked this brand just because it says real turbinado sugar and other brands in the local food store that their sugar is brown because it is colored with caramel or something br br how did i find out i needed just a sweet water few days ago i put this sugar in the raw in the glass the water became brown and on the bottom of the glass i got just pure white sugar crystals what a shame on the producer u can try to put this sugar in your mouth and after few seconds you will spit out pure white crystals as well br br im just wondering if the consumers can hold the company liable for such a practice its just sugar in the raw its flavor profile is much better then white sugar and its suppose to be better for you or something i just wish the bags were resealable this is a delicious sugar it has a pretty light brown color and delicious aroma but the granules are quite big however bigger than plain refined sugar this makes is difficult to cream butter and sugar together but if you use it in a recipe where you will melt the sugar first before baking it or if you use it to brew beer and plan to boil it to melt it it is a great product it would be the perfect sugar if only the granules were a bit finer i only use raw sugar it did seem a little smaller than the normal crystals but it is still good will buy again this sugar is very good use this in your coffee cereal etc for a week and youll never go back to white sugar white sugar will taste terrible plus from what ive read this raw sugar contains a lot of minerals that are missing in our diets br br the product was delivered fast and wellpackaged my only complaint is the price i wish i could find raw sugar cheaper i would be happy to buy in bulk but this is the cheapest i have found i thought this was a great buy but as noted by scott d the molasses content was not up to par i loved the higher molasses content sugar in the raw unfortunately what i purchased recently does not have the higher molasses content and i have twelve 24 ounce bags i guess ill watch for the next crop i really love this sugar and pricewise its much cheaper to buy it here on amazon compared to anywhere else love this sugar it tastes so much better and isnt as overly sweet tasting as regular sugar weve used it in quite a few baking items and they always turn out very good the price that amazon has this set at is very good to and makes it easy to use this for everyday stuff cant say anything bad about sugar in the raw i like it better than the other natural sugars better consistency and i know it doesnt matter but better color unfortunately one of the natural paper bags got torn a bit in the box it didnt look like the box was damaged so i cant tell how it happened but it was sort of pain to clean up half a bag that spilled all over the inside of the box and our kitchen when i opened it not sure what the solution is and id order it again but if it happens again id switch to one of the brands that ship in an unnatural plastic bag great service items arrived faster than expected very efficient will use this seller again i highly recommend this seller thank you for the excellent service please ignore the onestar comments if you check the bag the main ingredient is in fact whole grain brown rice and the second is rice flower with anything that is gluten free you have to add another binder which is where the corn flour comes in for someone who has celiac disease and can not have sunchips because they contain wheat a key binder to any chip cookie or cereal this is an excellent product my spouse and i buy these a lot because they are gluten free and absolutely delicious best flavor ever im addicted they are all good but these are by far the best i could live on these and there is no need for anymore to say so many healthy products dont taste very good or taste good when you first try them and then go downhill ive had these chips on more than one occasion and they are very tasty ive served them to guests twice and both times they wanted to know what they were and where to get them its also nice to have something glutenfree for friends who are borderline diabetic but i would eat them anyway i found these crisps at our local walmart figured i would give them a try they were so yummy i may never go back to regular chips not that i was a big chip fan anyway the only problem is i can eat the entire bag in one sitting i give these crisps a big thumbs up this is one of the best tasting crisps i have ever eaten i only buy it on special occassions because i know ill eat the whole bag i paid 179 for a 2 ounce pkg of these at lunch today i bought them because brown rice is a good carb as soon as i tasted one and it tasted like a corn chip i checked the ingredients the name is deceptive these have masa corn flour listed in the ingredients and it overwhelms the taste i wont buy these again i can get sunchips for less money and similar taste i use the rotel mild and i love this product so muchit saves me on a daily basis if youre trying to cook lower fat healthier foods and in a hurry this stuff makes it so much easier ever notice that some canned tomatos have a weird tin can taste when you make spagehetti sauce or whatever for some reason this product doesnt have that it tastes so good you can just dump it in with a can of beans heat and eat br br or add some chili powder and now you have chili soup i also make indian dishes with this and spicey spaghetti sauce i also prefer this to most canned salsas so it works for things like quesadillas if you drain the liquid off br br none of my local grocery stores carry it at all nor do they carry anything like it so i have to pay amazons inflated price to order this by the case i dont like that im paying a higher price but i love love love the product the price on this product certainly raises my attention on compairing amazon price with the local stores i can get a can of this rotel at my local kroger for 1 dissapointing howdy yall br br the actual product is very good id rate the item a 4 on its own however its only one dollar at the local grocery and twenty eight dollars per twelve pack these are running almost two and a half dollars each br br as i said too expensive sigh i was really hoping to get them at something approaching the local cost br br take care br lee nothing wrong with the product but i sure had to mix it with lots of other ingredients to make it edible to me in texas i was called a babymouth not into very spicyhot foods br br for comparison im comfortable with tostitos medium chunky salsa 1 can of this milder rotel mixed with 2 slightly larger cans of diced tomatoes was still way too hot for me to use as salsa for chips i used some of this to make a sort of southwestern cornbread that was good though this is a fantastic product and i wish it was readily available in most stores its taste is not the greatest but its a 25 oz shot and its gone in a second it tastes more or less like a concentrated sweet tea for the record ive had 5 hour energy and that tastes far worse i will put up the taste for the results its got 150mg of caffeine which is the equivalent of the big red bulls and monsters i cant stand sucralose and sugar substitutes and this is one of the only shot sized energy drinks that has only sugar in it the sugar is at 9g which isnt horrible i used to drink 4 16oz red bulls a day for the caffeine and this gives me far better energy and is much more subtle my preference is black coffee but i cant drink 812 cups a day anymore overall steaz does it right real organic ingredients in moderate amounts and they create big results i have to get up really early to work out before work and i get super tired by the middle of the afternoon i was drinking one 5 hour energy usually extra strength each day it worked well but gave me a jittery feeling almost headachy but not quite my husband got me to try this and i was skeptical but for me it works as well if not better than the 5 hour energy and doesnt give me that jittery almostheadache feeling br br i dont mind the tasteit reminds me of the inside of a fig newton mmm and the price is ok on amazon anyway at my grocery store they were almost 3 each yike br br and its organicso i can feel good about it right its all about me feeling good i bought these for my husband and he said they are the best energy shots out there he takes one in the mornings and works hard all day good stuff i am a energy junkie and im not sure if this works or not but what i do know is that the taste is not the greatest i do drink the steaz energy drink and i think i get the same results i like this products because it is more natural then the others if you want an organic energy shot your choices are this one from steaz and the assorted flavors from guayaki guayaki yerba mate is actually in the steaz energy shot and energy drinks and they both use sambazon acai so there are some similarities in ingredients br br great energy burst for 4 hours on a steaz energy shot and no withdrawals or headaches afterwards plan on drinking one every day at lunch at work this will help me cut down on my iced coffees which are not helping my calorie intake br br already ordering 12 packs on subscribe and save 2 per month great value i was looking for a natural energy shot that works and i found it steaz energy shot is my favorite br br i recently had gastric bypass surgery so tons of sugar is a nono and im also allergic to sucralose splenda so most other energy drinks are out br br i tried bazi energy shots and they didnt work as well as steaz and definitely didnt taste as well these have a taste thats almost like cocacolanot bad at all br br if youre looking for natural energy give these a try i had tried both of the guayaki energy shots and i dont like the taste of either of them this one has more natural caffeine and tastes much better i like them cold for sure my husband and i take these on road trips in a little cooler with ice and waters and we dont have to make stops for coffee especially on the turnpikes where its just way too expensive its worth the per shot we normally split them im really sensitive to caffeine even the natural kind so i get a little weird if i drink the whole thing but thats the same for coffee too for me my husband drinks the whole shot and gets a nice wake up boost i would recommend these over any of the sinthetic shots out there you can feel good about putting this in your body ill be ordering again soon for sure i purchased it because it was on sale in terms of the energy it provides it works but the taste leaves something to be desired i tried mixing it with some water to make it more drinkable ive been feeling extremely tired around the late afternoon as a software engineer this is entirely unacceptable so i asked the nice lady at the counter of my local whole foods market for something that will give me that extra energy i need to get through the day br br she excitedly returned with a suspicious little green bottle over three hours after drinking whatever that was my brain is still working at unnatural speeds to summarize my experiences i believe this works br br she did explain that i needed to drink plenty of water with it which i personally feel helped the energy level so if youre feeling tired during the day and hate coffee give this a shot preferably before you eat anything br br woot the energy shot truly does work it had a terrible aftertaste at first but now that i know what to expect i am getting used to it i always have some water handy as a chaser which helps i am so glad to have found something that gives me the energy i need without all the chemicals found in other beverages its helped me kick my addiction to diet coke and other aspartamelaced caffeinated beverages yay ive tried 5 hour energy red rain nos and other energy shots this is my favorite in terms of taste and effect plus its somewhat reassuring to know that natural ingredients are used sometimes i wonder what im really putting into my body with some of the other brands i purchase a box about once every 2 months for the past 2 years if youre looking for an energy boost without artificial sweeteners and other chemicals this is a great option the taste is decent and it is a nice smooth uplift without jitters i first found steaz berry energy shots at a local organic market i bought two bottles which cost just under three dollars each i fell in love instantly the drink is delicious i can taste the yerba mate and the acai juice like a slightly bitter fruity chocolate honey tea i am very sensitive to sucralose splenda which is in so many energy drinks these days i also hate the taste i love that steaz has actual sugar and no artificial sweeteners the rush it gives me is slow and even i have several medical conditions including fibromyalgia which saps me of energy and causes intense pain i like how steaz helps clear away the fatigue and fog so i can get things done no caffeine jitters even though there are 150 mg of caffeine in each bottle br it was becoming expensive for me to buy the bottles separately at stores so i started looking online for a bulk price i am so thrilled to have found the pack of 12 on amazon i signed up for amazon prime specifically for this product hah i have tried other energy shots and this one is the only one that really makes me feel good and energized without any other sides effects at all its also the best taste others taste like medicine this one has a tea fresh taste i love it i drive otr over the road truck and this helps to keep me alert it has no sugar high no crash im on a autoship which i like the price is very good ive seen it over 2 bucks in the store products takes pretty good and it doesnt leave you gittery with subscibe and save as well as prime membership i pay below 2 a shot my wife tried them and now she drinks them like they are going out of style i moderate mine and they make for more effective use before weight training i recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a healthier alternative to high sugar and unnatural products that are everywhere that still gives you the results of an awesome energy drink i use this product daily and it provides a steady stream of energy i do not get jittery or crash it also helps me practice portion control because it acts as a slight appetite suppressant ive been buying and drinking this for over a year now and the energy boost is excellent with a continuous 6 hour effect the most recent shipments seem to have improved the flavor slightly as well or perhaps im getting more used to it i dont drink it for the flavor but its not as heinous as the fake flavors found in the other nonorganic energy shots this is the first time ive really been misled by other reviews on amazon i like 5 hr energy i find rain ok and so i thought id try this product based on the reviews boy am i sorry i gagged getting one bottle down even with my nose pinched really and it leaves the worst medicinal taste in your mouth afterwards 8 tic tacs at once did not get rid of it but worst of all within an hour i was yawning and drowsy unless you really like things that taste of a weird teaflavored cough syrup and dont work dont buy this i dont know what to do with the other 11 bottles big fail i loved this mold i wished i could have used it for more than one occasion but it didnt last i did use it to make 30 suckers for my daughters first birthday but there was going to be no way that the mold could be salvaged after that i would have liked to have kept to use on other occasions but for the price it didnt matter to me that much it served its main purpose you have to try the vanilla tootsie rolls the regular chocolate ones are good but these are the best ever try this you might like it i did and i am quite addicted it is too easy to prepare it tastes great and it absorbs the flavors you cook it with the price is really good and well worth the purchase if you like this type of couscous like i do then give this one a tryit can be eaten hot room temp or in a cold salad with a variety of greens and other flavors it takes on the other flavors very well when mixed i cooked the couscous with a broth and oilive oil for added flavor and it rocked my taste buds big time i will be back for more this tricolor couscous is really good full of flavor and fun to eat i love the texture i cook in chicken broth and add some minced garlic and chopped herbs parsley cilantro along with some red pepper flakes at the end of cooking i add some olive oil and this makes a wonderful side dish highly recommend i tried to find israeli couscous in a number of upsacale grocery stores and no luck so i decided to try good ole amazoncom and selected this product it is so good add a few herbs and its a great side dish or add more and make a pasta type saladso very good i am hooked great flavor and so easy to prepare the package came with the label torn off and no cooking instructions i know how i normally cook couscous so tried 34 cup water to 1 cup couscousbrought to a boil and let sit covered for 5min it was mushy and tastelesswe have thrown out the rest of the container i wouldnt even think of buying this product unless i know the price per unit how can i compare other items online or in a store i love ordering whole bean coffee on amazon i like this so much that this my first product review i have to say that im usually not a big fan of flavored coffee but i thought i would give it a try when my husband started grinding it up i could smell it throughout the house sometimes with flavored coffees the smell is there but the taste isnt however not with this one im now going to order another flavor from this company and will give it a try i love this coffee i do wish it came already ground as i dont have a grinder and use a blender instead but its worth it many flavored coffees ive tried only seem to have a flavored odor that doesnt reach the coffee but this one manages both this brand of coffee has been available in my local stores for some time ive believe the company is local ive been drinking it for quite some time and have not tired of it im particularly fond of the turtle sundae but all the flavors are good i cant say that ive had a bad one br br as it turns out its less expensive to order it from amazon and have it show up at my front door than it is for me to run out to the local walmart to get it its a no brainer try it if you like rich flavored coffee youll like it it is hot i love it tasty and a little sweet i usually scoff at salsas labeled as hot but this one lives up to its billing i consume about a jar every two weeks of this either adding it to fajitas or using it as a corn chip dip it is hot but after awhile the medium salsa suprema was too mild for me i thought maybe id cut down how much i ate by going to the hot salsa ranchera its hot enough that people who arent used to it will say thats hot br br flavor bright and forward the similarly hot salsa victoria is a duller taste to me i guess earthy this salsa is much brighter in the mouth i dont like to go hotter than this because the sauces ive tried lose any resemblance to yummy salsa and just taste hot this happens to me with tabasco sauce for example br br a drawback is la victoria doesnt make a larger bottle of salsa ranchera nor salsa victoria nor do they sell them in or sams club to get a good deal you have to watch for sales service was great but i meant to buy swiss chalet chicken sauce not the marinade br br love the sauce have yet to try the marinade use frequently as we like to do asian dishes at least once a week love this product fast shipping as usual would buy again these individually wrapped pieces are delicious although i wish there were a few more mildly sweet with no sugarfree aftertaste even a traditional marzipanaholic should enjoy these put this in my husbands stocking for christmas and it was a hit i was amazed at how quickly it arrived it is a cute stocking stuffer but only ok as far as user appeal you get what you pay for toy was typical quality i expected i got taken for a major ride on the shipping so we cancelled the order it was cancelled without any problem that is a positive note i love the convenience of the singles the best creamer aroundtaste is just like the big bottle i can stick them in my purse and take them to work these creamers come in 4 packs of 25 i have taken one to work and opened one for home so far and havent found a single broken or leaking creamer yet i usually have way too much cream and sugar in my coffee but with these it is easy for me to cut down on the sweetness because i wont allow myself more than 2 creamers per cup i think this is definitely the best option for buying creamers from amazon since all the other listings have a lot of complaints about creamers breaking in shipping even though we are international delight fans we were not completely dissapointed by this product we had no problem with the shipment but the creamer itself is thinner than international delight other than that we are happy d besides the obvious convenience and portability of the individual creamers i liked this item specifically because of packaging i couldnt believe how many reviews i read about coffee creamer cups but many of the amazon creamer options both coffeemate and international delight had multiple negative reviews due to the shipment arriving with broken cups thanks to sloppy packaging br br that was not an issue here the shipment arrived in four dispensing boxes of 50 each as shown in the photo those boxes were tightly packed in a thick cardboard box which could take a good beating before damaging the inner boxes thus none of my cups were broken no waste and no sloppy drippy mess plus the four boxes means i could put one in the kitchen one in the bathroom we moved our mini keurig there when we upgraded the kitchen keurig best idea my husband ever had and one at work with a reserve for whichever runs out first br br if you are looking for these mini creamers but deterred like i was by the negative packaging reviews on other options this is your best bet as a bonus the auto delivery price is very reasonable this seller is very nice and the price is very good the only reason i stop ording is bacause i went to sugar free and at that time he did not have it but for those of you that dont have to watch there fat in take i would get this product from them i purchased these coffee mate singles to use at work along with the coffee tea bags theyre great because they dont require refrigeration i received the items in a timely manner upon receipt i removed a pack to consume the poptart was stale and left an awful taste in my mouth i found these new spring poptarts and bought them on a whim my kids and i were amazed and delighted at the fun colorful amazingly detailed artwork on these poptarts fantastic for after school snacks lunch boxes and school treats tie with a ribbon for a bright thinking of you this spring gift the only challenge is finding more in stores way to go kelloggs fantastic product yes i am having a cup right now i went all over town looking for this coffee after been invited to a non profit organization to a banquet and besides the delicious food they top it off with this amazing delicious coffee i paid and extra 20 bucks to get it right way and it is worth the money highly recommend taste like it is stale will not order this again i had this coffee at a 50th year annerversery at a reception hall and had to have it this stuff tasted nothing like the douwe egberts at the hall this is possibly stale coffee serveice delivery with the seller was excellent the product was not will not order again bad taste iam not sure if it was old or that how it tastes i throw it right away i coudl not drink it this is honestly the best seasoning salt in all the land it tightens up any dish not spicy just perfectly seasoned its perfect hence my purchase of this 35 oz mamma jamma the order arrived as advertised i have had only a few chances to use it but it is awesome the flavor is exactly what i hoped for it may take me a while to finish the entire gallon but i will definnantly order again i like a lot of sesame oil and use it in salads regularly great quality flavor and aroma cant beat that its organic bought a set of two when my son was about 6 months and we started taking them with us whenever we went out to eat i cut up cantaloupe apple banana even used sweet potatoes a few times just whatever i could get at the restaurant and it would keep my son busy long enough that i could actually eat its great because i didnt have to be overly worried about him choking on big chunks and he got to try out new foods i wouldnt hesitate to buy this again i have a slightly different version of this different brand my son started using it around six months and he really enjoys it he does get messy if he eats something sticky or juicy like banana or watermelon but whatever anyway i also had trouble cleaning it until i tried scrubbing it with a nail or vegetable brush that works pretty well it takes some time but not as much as it would take to run food through a food mill or blender or cut it up then clean it up off him the chair the floor the dog me well you get the picture what a great idea my daughter love it br i dont think is difficult to wash i mean is not like just toss water and thats it but come on br absolutely recommend it this product is impossible to wash and actually get cleaned i couldnt get the food pieces out to save my life i tried scrubbing them out and even washed it in the dishwasher as it suggests i loved this product for fruits and other food that i didnt want my new baby to choke on i also used it to put ice in when my baby was teething it worked great for this as well as for the food i didnt like bananas in it thoughimpossible to get clean i love love love the idea of this product and my little one loves loves loves to use it she gets fresh fruit and other tasty things and i dont have to worry about her choking the only drawback is that bits of food get stuck in the mesh and the seams and are impossible to get out granted some foods are more difficult than others and some dont cause that much of a problem bananas however have pretty much destroyed a couple of them while i love this product i think that next time i will get the one that has the removable and replaceable mesh bags the munchkin fresh food feeder is an okay product its kind of like sucking on food through a cloth while my daughter was interested in it for a little while she eventually lost interest i may introduce it back to her again and see how she reacts this product is amazing i know a few people with little ones that use these and they love them super easy to clean and use when ordering these i was under the impression that there were 2 per package fyitheyre not only one per i ordered these for my coffee themed wedding when they arrived i had to fight off friends because they smelled and tasted so good i literally had to hide the box to the wedding they were a big hit on my wedding day and there were none left over that we put on the tables it was a great tasting product for the lowest price ive seen these are delicious the chocolate is excellent and the espresso bean was the perfect roast for this purpose crunchy and not bitter a href chocolate covered espresso beans 5 pounds a the product was exactly as advertised and fresh unfortunately i keep them in a candy dish in the office and they are going fast we need to reorder to keep up with demand these chocolate covered espresso beans are wonderful the chocolate is very dark and rich and the bean inside is a very delightful blend of flavors with just enough caffine to really give it a zing popchips are so good i have been following weight watchers and lost 50 pounds and am at my goal these popchips are my salty crunchy indulgence they taste so good ive purchased dozens of bags of this pancake mix which is a great product by the way this is the highest price ive seen whole foods carries this item and its been on sale there for 999 thats canadian dollars too as im in canada its even cheaper on bakers boxs own website and theyre the company selling this product through amazon for a twopack they should be charging 20 or less what gives i thought amazon was where you could find competitive prices the sugar was sweet that can not be denied as advertised it didnt melt when baked either however it will not do for your liege waffles gaufres what the larger pebbles of belgian pearl will do these grains are smaller think pretzel salt or seed pearls thats exactly what i was looking for to bake some chouquettes puffs with small sugar pearls on top works great yum this is what i was looking for and was missing it the taste is exactly the taste as the one made in india so just loved it and remember my days back in india definitely recommend it i bought this strawberry extract hoping to spruce up a strawberry wine that ended up with less flavor than id original expected a common problem in some fruit wines br br this is indeed good strawberry flavor just add to your sugary concoction be it a baking good a dessert or a drink to either give strawberry flavor or add to existing flavor and presto just about everyone will be licking their lips and maybe fingers br br for those interested i found the right addition to a liquid volume to be 4 oz of extract per 1 gallon of liquid great stuff and dependable especially when there are a million brands out there to choose from i love the stuff for really high end desires i go with the apollo olive oils from california but i buy a whole lot more of this stuff and will buy it again and again i hadnt tried or heard of till recently weavers not its my favorite i am running through the list of types they have looking for a favorite and havent found one yet theyre all so darned smooth no bite no after taste a little pricy but still worth it no worse price wise than starbucks or peets will keep running through the list here and see what happens love them all so far having always been a strict peets coffee lover i was reticent to switch brands but weavers won my heart the taste is clean and strong the ethos is correct organic baby and even the packaging is very zen and appropriate be still my caffeinated heart go ahead and drink the other brands served at your neighborhood cafe if you must but make sure you have a stash of weavers peru organic whole bean at home to serve up to your friends and family who deserve the best coffee and when you go back to that corner cafe where people drink average coffee because they dont know better take along a travel mug filled with weavers coffee from home and enjoy a real cup of joe er weavers a very bitter tasting coffee even when enhanced with cream and or honey definately not my cup of coffee oh did i say it was bitter im learning that latin american and south american coffees have this distinct coffee caramelish finish as a peets coffee fanatics we learned that weavers roaster was the roaster for peets and we are hooked i already reviewd the french and organic blend but i must say this coffee here is a perfect afternoon drink br met the weavers team at the warner brothers party and they gave me a half a pound of french roast since them we are fans br you wont be dissapointed i like eating these whenever i need an energy boost br it has everything that i am searching for in a to go snack br fiber plus chocolate is never a bad thing these are my favorite bars ever the combo of raisons and dark choc is wonderful very filling these are hard to find in the stores im thankful for subsrcibe and save my fiance loves these dark chocolate and nut granola bars and all the grocery stores around us dont carry them anymore once again amazon came through and he couldnt be happier i was buying quaker oats granola bars but these nature valley chewy bars are better tasting they make a great snack when im on the go chocolate peanuts and raisins it doesnt get any better hard to get husband to eat breakfast before school he takes two bars now and is very happy to do so it is often hard to find flavor in local grocery stores so again amazoncom came through with a reasonable price now i came keep the husbands breakfast ready as he runs out the door in the mornings i often like to have a bar in the evening as a night snack nantucket blend coffee is one of my favorites i was suprised that it was a single box every time i ordered before it was a 2 pack my fault for not reading closer i will not order any more at this price for 1 24 count green mountain nantucket blend kcups make a very good cup of coffee in my a href

frustrationfree packaging a i generally drink in the morning br br these are good on both small and large cup settings as well br br highly recommended br br cfh when we received our keurig elite for christmas we were so excited to break open the sample pack of pods to try out different blends and flavors of the 12 pods we had in the box four were green mountain coffee brand id never tried anything from this company before but from what i had researched online they have the largest range of keurig pods and have even bought out competitors to produce coffee under their brand names as well br br unfortunately i was immediately disappointed by the quality of the coffee we tried their dark magic decaf and breakfast blend and all were underwhelming to say the least i was almost completely set on writing off green mountain altogther br br we had one gm pod left and being of the mindset of wastenotwantnot i figured id give it one last go around before forgetting about them completely and im glad i did br br the nantucket blend is a perfectly pleasing cup of coffee it is nice and flavorful without being thick and pungent unlike some of the other gm blends we tried i added some flavored creamer to it and it almost measures up to our goto caribou blend pods almost all in all this is a very standard cup of coffee which while it isnt anything new or exciting is very pleasing and definitely one of the better keurig options weve been able to test out when we run out of all the pods weve accumulated ill probably pick up a box of these as well br br now that i know green mountain isnt completely disappointing ill definitely be open to trying a few more of their coffees with our promotion for getting the bewer we ordered a href green mountain coffee golden french toast kcup portion pack for keurig kcup brewers 24 count a to try as well and see how it goes from there br br if youre looking for a goto choice this is your cup green mountain is my favorite brand nantucket is my favorite coffee from green mountain very smooth flavor not too strong and not too weak i was looking for a replacement for timothys kona blend which is no longer carried on amazon this coffee from green mountain is very nice but not strong enough for me if you like milder coffees then this one is for you one of green mountains best blends of coffee in my opinion love it for your everyday blend perfect stregnth excellent blend this is just fantastic chicken noodle soup the best i have ever eaten with large hearty chunks of chicken and vegetables and nice large noodles this soup is just so full bodied and is seasoned just right i am so glad amazon carries this product i just cant find it here in vermont i have used this oil for several years and it is the best for eating with bread or cooking i love the regular i use it on everything you wont be sorry you tired it great for dipping bread and cooking omelet and green beans oh my gosh is this good like most people ive been eating ketchup my whole life and never really thought anything about it then hubby brought a jar of this home the tomato flavor is amazing i will never buy store ketchup every again sir kensingtons did a great job of updating the classic ketchup with this wonderful product the refreshed taste of this ketchup is a great update and now leaves me disappointed when im given heinz while out at a restaurant br br for you heinz die hard fans out there this is not the ketchup for you but for those of you who wish you always knew what ketchup could be without the chemical aftertaste found in heinz be sure to give this ketchup a try br br dont forget the spiced variety purchasing the pack with both the classic and spiced variety for your first sir kensington experience is definitely the way to go this is ridiculous the best gourmet ketchup i have ever tasted it is pricey but wow love this stuff it would make a great gift for someone who is hard to buy for but loves their ketchup yummy the tomatoes are the star of the classic flavor it is clean and really fresh perfect on an avocado chicken sandwich br br the spicy flavor is more complex and is the best ketchup i have ever tried it is so good i have now used it on foods that would make me seem crazy the spicy version of this ketchup isnt bad but it is too expensive the regular version is sweet as dessert horrible annies organic has a much better flavor and costs a lot less even heinz organic is a better deal i gave it three stars instead of two because it is in glass not plastic these condiments are overpriced and terrible the classic is disgustingly sweet the spiced tastes like a bad spicy marinara sauce from a chain restaurant i have been using porcini mushrooms in my cooking for twenty plus years the roland extra fancy porcinis that i purchased from you are the best that i have ever used including the mushrooms that i bought in italy and transported back to the usa i was pretty pleased with these mushrooms they were mostly large pieces rehydrated well and had good flavor id estimate about 25 of the contents were broken into medium to small pieces most likely due to the shaking about in transit not a problem since i sometimes break the large pieces into smaller ones for some recipes there was a small amount perhaps an ounce or so of very small mincedsize dustlike pieces still useful to add into gravies and the like nothing gets wasted br br the label says it is a product of china and italy nothing was specified as to the proportion from each country br br im quite fond of dried mushrooms while they may lack the texture you can get only when using fresh ones the convenience of always having them on hand is a big plus additionally i find the broth used to rehydrate them adds a wonderful flavor to soups and stews to save time and add flavor i sometimes add the dried mushrooms directly into the soup or stew without rehydrating them really helps meld all the flavors together i also am fond of adding some to the cooking water when boiling pasta the pasta picks up a wonderful earthy flavor when it cooks in the mushroominfused water br br this was the first time i used the roland brand got it on a price dip from the amazon warehouse and would certainly buy them again highly recommend if you are a peanut lover these are for you much larger than cocktail peanuts six people on my christmas gift list ask for these every year the cashews were nice and big with the vast majority being whole there were a number of small pieces at the bottom of the bag but thats pretty expected with so many cashews they made an absolutely excellent cashew brittle br br my order took just over a week to arrive which was pretty decent considering it was shipped across the country they came double bagged in clear plastic bags and in two 5 lb portions this was highly convenient since i could just throw one of the bags into the freezer until i was ready to work with it br br great value for the price although there were several shriveled ones they taste just fine i mostly use them to make vegan sauces and other recipes that call for running them through a food processor so they dont have to look perfect anyways for the price they are a great deal about half of what i find them for in the store i ordered these after a fair bit of searching online even ordering the smaller 13 oz bags i will admit i was a bit sceptical when i ordered this since it was not cheap and had no idea how good or bad the cashews would be br br the order came in pretty fast like 3 days the cashews were fresh and whole with like 10 broken pieces they were in 2 5lb bags sealed with clear tape first i found it odd but then it turned out to be a good deal considering the second pack stayed fresh till i opened them the trick is to actually keep them in an airtight box so that they stay fresh longer br br the only negative i can think of is that the price went up abt 500 for the 10lb since i bought them these nuts arrived fresh and are very tasty they are not broken or dirty looking like cashews sometimes can i bought these for my boyfriend who really likes honey roasted pecans in salads that i have at a couple of restaurants plus he likes nuts pecans almonds peanuts he loved these i actually ordered 3 cans instead of the gift tin so he could take one to work or his place and stay fresh longer although i dont think freshness will be an issue they wont last long lol my cat will go for a day probably longer havent tryed it but hell walk right by this stuff every time even when i know hes hungery absolutely no interest i swear hed rather die of starvation then even take a wiff of it got this free with another order i placed i couldnt believe how much the cats loved it i will buy again for sure this is a great ham soup base i have used it in ham and beans and seasoned greenbeans great flavor i havent used the ham base it is loaded with msg i did not realize this when i ordered it and can not return it because it is a food item before i discover this mix on amazon i always bought it in whole food store br i like this mix and when i am doing the pancakes they came very delicious and fluffy br just one small secret try to add the seltzer water instead of regular one i appreciate the fact that i can buy this product online and have free shipping this is a great all around mix that is very good with a wonderful texture thanks again amazon arrowhead mills buttermilk pancake mix is my favorite mix it tastes great cooks up light and fluffy and is super easy to make although it can be made using water i think its better made with milk i love it with pure organic maple syrup the pancakes taste great without any recipe adjustments for my sons egg allergy its also great for camping or any time youd like to be able to make pancakes without having fresh eggs available hey these are great waffles and pancakes we have to add 50 more

allergy br they taste fine for our family we like them many ways i love the flour however amazon sent it with a book which broke a bag and made a mess customer sevice took care of the problem however it was a foolish way to ship the product this mix is very poorly packaged and breaks open easily during shipping nearly a full bag of my order was spilled in the shipping box 3 bags out of 4 had come unsealed at the top there were no tears in the packages just awful i thought food was supposed to taste good i had to eat ice cream afterwards to get the taste out of my mouth its that bad perhaps the worst bottle of wine ive ever had im not even sure i would cook with this it is thin no body and a transparent color not characteristic of a good pinot the taste is just bitter not the complexity that i expect from a pinot noir of any price just not what im looking for even in a low to mid price pinot noir maybe my bottle wasnt sealed well and went to vinegar other reviews for this wine are favorable a good tasting light chip that has some value in nutrition everyone get the munchies is this is a good alternative to eating potato chips this is a wonderful warm flavored tea especially now in colder weather br this tea has a sweet soothing chamomile fragrance it is subtle and sweetit s one of the better chamomile teas br if you find it hard to sleep at times a cup of this sweet chamomile tea may help br if you really like sweet taste try bigelow chamomile mango herbal tea br i highly recommend both this is one of the best mint chocolate syrup ive ever had so far the others pale in flavor by comparison there are only seven ingredients in this sauce including organic natural mint flavor in the past i used ice cream heavy with other flavors like butterscotch chocolate chips oreo cookies caramel et al because the mint flavor of other mint chocolate sauces was too pale now i buy plain vanilla or chocolate ice cream and the minty flavor of the santa cruz organic mint chocolate syrup really stands out but doesnt overpower the flavor of the ice cream there are only 110 calories and because the mint flavor is very apparent to my taste i use it sparingly so this 155 oz container last a bit longer than the other syrups i used this is a simple product and it is simply good there are no extra ingredients that are hard to pronounce and have you scouring the internet finding out what they are it is a bit thinner consistency than the usual syrup so use caution the first time you go to squeeze some out this will be great for people who like mint it has a much stronger mint flavor than chocolate i use it in my coffee with a bit of half and half tastes great sometimes simple is better a grande item delicious fish with the ultimate flavor best ever in a can for all purposes i sent a case to my mother recently diagnosed with diabetes and she loves it as a main entree for cooking patties i ordered this product at the same time as the kirkland signature salmon the raincoast trading co salmon is very tasty equally as good quality salmon as the kirkland however the raincoast arrived in perfect condition the kirkland cans were dented badly i recommend this product to anyone who likes boneless skinless canned salmon this tea tastes almost as good as the tea you would get at an indian restaurant its much better than getting a teabag and making it the english way with a lot of water and a bit of milk this is very creamy and tasty my only criticism is that there arent enough sachets in the box only 10 since the directions say that you use one sachet for 100ml of water approximately half a cup its not enough for a good cup of tea so i use two that means that one box is only good enough for five cups of tea but its a delicious afterdinner drink i would buy this again if there were more sachets in a box i love this product cant find it locally sometimes little out of the way stores have itbut i also love the chicken pork chop bagsevery store i go in i look for them the lastplace i found it was at a meat market this is the best way to cook a roast our local grocery went out of buisness and so i could not find this product till i looked here please continue to keep this product available its always a pleasure to find frenchs products on the web all of the markets in my area have made a bargain to carry nothing but mccormacks bland and tasteless seasonings br br this is the most flavorful cooking bag mix you will ever find if you like oreos or the oreo cakester then youve got to try the double stuff cakesters these are the best side note shipping was very slow but maybe your chances will be better i was surprised about how good this was my family and friends laughed when i told them i bought this but out of the can ready mix with a little salt pepper spinach and some cheese and its a great easy meal the thing about marmite is that those who dont like it hate it and those who love it cant live without it its very much an english thing and the language has even adopted the trade name as a metaphor as in victoria beckham is marmite meaning that those who dont like her etc amazon has done the world a favor by making this weird and wonderful stuff available at an affordable price last time i looked it was 25 a 500g jar in british stores in lacounty or about 4x what it costs in england the amazon supplier was quick and efficient and i now have enough marmite to last me to the end of the year or would have if i didnt decide to send one of the two jars to my son in japan good job amazon a vile miserable pancake i put these in front of my toddler one morning and she actually cried i dont know if it was their flat and anemic appearance or their salty bitter taste only the whole wheat flour is organic in this mix the buttermilk baking soda sls and sea salt are not i am going back to natures path buttermilk pancake mix this one went straight into the garbage whats there to say about a fantastic chocolate chip cookie the only thing that could be improved is if they offered a bushel box of these so you would not run out so fast hope these dont go the way of the dinosaur these arrived on time and packaged in green plastic wrap the cookies were as fresh as the boxes found in the local grocery store br br i have no complaints but i also now have no more cookies we ate them all i was not expecting to like these cookies as much as i do i like chocolate chip cookies well enough but i really prefer a soft cookie to crisp ones i have to say these famous amos cookies have pertty much turned me around the cookies are rich and have that depth of flavor that comes from quality ingredients the chips are real chocolate and melt redilly in your mouth creating a moist experience while chewing these are truly great cookies they arent fattening and theyre good for you right thats what i heard at least from an admittedly unreliable person great if you are cutting back on fat they do resemble regular chips but are nothing like them extremely dry and hard i have never met a kettle brand chip i did not like these chips have a great loaded potato flavor which are flavorful i like the sweet onion chips better but these are also at the top of the list for greattasting potato chips kettle chips are great chips f the money after buying bags one at a time at a hefty markup at nearby stores i decided to try bulk ordering some snack foods on amazon i was very pleased with the price and the products br br these jalapeno kettle chips are not overly spicy they have a slowbuilding spice that starts very subtly a grows if you eat the whole bag which im embarrassed to say i did quite a few times br br the chips arrived wellpacked and fresh they had nearly a year of time before they expired which is pretty impressive for chips br br most importantly the priceperbag was much much better than any local store could do although i live near an expensive city so that may play a role in the price difference br br i wouldnt hesitate to order another box of these once i run out i buy mostly for vending so the size of the bag is important kettles 1 oz bag is a good size although it seems a bit less than full salt vinegar flavor is satisfying about an 8 out of 10 glad to find these in a one ounce size but the bag seems a bit less than full its hard to find single serving chip bags that vend well sometimes they are too wide or too plump with air bag size is good bbq flavor is about an 8 out of 10 one of the best chips that you can buy and ive tried all the kettle varieties and many others theres only a slight taste of jalapeno and they are delicious perfect with a sandwich or alone br if you like being addicted these are the chip for you see you at addicts anonymous the title says it all great flavor hint of spice excellent crunch we eat kettle chips by the truck load at my house we like all the flavors but this one far and away is our favorite never enough bags to get us to our next shipment i just wish amazon could get the larger bags on subscribe and save if you buy these make sure you have enough for everyone otherwise you may not get enough for yourself wow i have eaten quite a few potato chips in my day kettle chips are the best nonbaked chips i have eaten i decided to try the sweet onion chips since ive never had them i now have a favorite if you like onions this is a must buy i will definitely reorder these as i mentioned above they are the best i have ever eaten the flavor is great i can not say how much i love kettle brand potato chips kettle brand has a large variety of unique flavors and the quality of the chips themselves blows all other potato chips out of the water the ingredients list is printed on each bag and the only thing really bad for it is the oil they are frying the chips in i love that these arent filled with nasty chemicals i ordered the cheddar and sour cream krinkle cut ones which are great but i was torn between the a href kettle brand potato chips fully loaded baked potato 2 ounce pack of 24 a and the jalapeno flavor while i know the jalapeno flavor is good but this is way better they include liquid smoke instead of actual bacon which im fine with since ive a vegetarian i ordered this to give to guests coming from out of town for my wedding this spring and i cant guarantee how many i will have left my fiance and i love these the packaging is perfect for anyone who is giving these to kids to take for school lunches or handing out in gift bags even just for portion control now i havent done a sidebyside comparison but these chips still taste like the real deal these snack sized bags do as well as the regular brand at the grocery store i work for portion control and reduced fat yes please with the subscribe save these are much cheaper than at the grocery store i love kettle brand chips br ive been in love with the honey dijon for years and decided to try out their other flavors br br sea salt vinegar chips are tangy sour and make my lips pucker when i eat too many at a time i got 12 big bags for a steal from amazon 11 what br br personally the flavor is too much for me but my mom aunt love them and they hate potato chips these chips are thick and crunchy i absolutely love them the taste is perfect i like to buy these smaller bags because i cant trust myself with a large bag of these because they taste no good i enjoy these chips i got these instead of my usual jalapeno ones from the same company for a bit of flavor change i think those are better but only slightly like the jalapenos there is a great amount of flavor without being too overpowering the small bag size prevents you from overeating as with a larger bag i love these chips i buy the 24 pack once a month the bags are just the right size for snacking and prevent me from eating way too much with the larger bags the jalapeno spice is subtle enough not to be overpowering but still gives you a great amount of flavor these are the strongest tasting salt and vinegar chips ive had i could still do with more vinegar flavor but i think this is as close as im going to get without dousing them with vinegar powder myself br br i did a side by side with the cape cod salt and vinegar and these are about twice as flavorful additionally as other reviewers have said they have quite a good bit of potassium in them somewhere in the neighbor of 15 rda per serving i have been ordering the sea salt chips for about a year i love them but my daughter picked some of these up at our local grocery store and now they are my new favoritewill be ordering them these are my favorite glutenfree dairyfree flavored chips many other salt and vinegar chips contain dairy so its nice to find ones that i can eat the vinegar flavor is really intense and good these kettle brand potato chips in the spicy thai flavor really do taste like food i have eaten at a thai restaurant the ingredients listed include garlic powder onion powder parsley jalapeno and spices im not sure what other spices there are but it sure tastes like lemongrass to me yum these chips are thick cut and very crunch they come in a seriously heavyduty bag i tried to open it like i do regular chip bags by pulling the two sides apart no way the bag is so thick i wondered if it was plastic i started looking for the scissors and decided that any company that put their chips in a bag this nice must have provided a way to open it sure enough there is a small slit on the top and the simple directions tear here so easy why didnt i think of that honey dijon flavor okay flavor but both my girlfriend and i thought they left a bad aftertaste the aftertaste is sort of like old cheese presumably some folks like this im not a fancy cheese eater and it lingers for at least an hour id give this flavor a rating of 2 stars out of 5 br br we have also tried the ny cheddar flavor 4 stars which we both liked better and they didnt leave any longlingering or bad aftertaste br br id give the consistency of the chips 4 stars the chips are crunchy but also greasy enough that i keep a napkin near or wash my hands after eating kettle chips for me kettle is the best brand on the market they really know how to turn the humble potato into something fit for the gods i didnt think anything could top their salt and pepper chips but these are my new favorite the flavors are pure and real they go great with just about everything and are highly addictive i hope they come out with a low fat version their low fat chips are excellent but they need more flavors salt and vinegar chips are definitely my favorite type of any potato chip these ones made by kettle were very tasty and i enjoyed them thoroughly i just wish there was a more healthy option with the same great taste what i like about them br 1 very thick chips br 2 no trans fat and all natural according to the info on the bag br 3 flavor but thats a subjective thing br 4 2oz bags which keep you from eating too much at one time just set a limit of 1 bag br br cons br as another reviewer said theres a lot of oil in them chips what i do is place a paper napkin on a plate and pour the chips on them wait a few mins before eating and the napkin will soak some of the oil off it seems gross that there is so much oil on the chip that a napkin will soak it off but its true and at least this way youll get rid of some of the oil these are so tangy it prevents me from eating too many a handful or two does the trick very crisp and savory i usually love kettle chips and love salt vinegar but these chips were way too vinegary for me they do have the typical kettle chip crunch but are too aggressively flavored for my taste i have always been a fan of kettle chips when you open a bag of kettle chips you know you are going to get quality these chips are no exception and live up to the name printed on the package br br the new york cheddar chips have a very subtle flavor to them you can taste the cheddar in them but it doesnt smack you in the face like supermarket brand chips might the taste lingers as well which is a definite plus br br another aspect about these kettle chips is the fact every chip is nice and crisp that crunch in your mouth on top of that there are no burnt chips in any of the bags i have had since the purchase the only negative i might have is that the flavoring of the chips is uneven some chips might pack a nice cheddar punch while another might taste rather plain this isnt a big flaw as it happens when getting seasoned and doesnt ruin the bag at all br br overall the quality of the chips is fantastic the flavor is great and you wont be disappointed especially if you are a cheddar lover tried many varieties of bbq chips and hands down these are the best on the market these r not too salty or greasy great crispy crunch plenty of good bbq flavor with a hint of sweetness that all other brands fall short of every bag after bag is just as mouth wateringly delicious as the 1st kettle chis are the best ever these used to be my favorite flavor until i tried their salt and pepper kind but im sure this is just a personal preference br br crunchy real potato chips these chips have the right amount of crunch and i enjoy the taste chips are consistent and have a fairly even distribution of seasoning i like the 2 oz size bags just the right amount of chips i subscribed to these one case every three months that comes out to about 5 a month for the convenience of having my favorite chips handy whenever i want because it seems fritolay has managed to crowd out every other chip vendor from pretty much all my local stores this is the best way to ensure a steady supply of the items i want rather than the items fritolay wants me to have the two ounce bags are larger than you might be used to buying at the subway for example which i find works very well theyre large enough to be a good snack on their own or you can even share a single bag over lunch the size is perfect for ensuring these fantastically crunchy chips are always fresh no chip clip needed br br the only problem i subscribed to four cases a year and having these yummy chips always in the pantry makes it really easy to increase ones kettle chip consumption definitely have to hide the case from the kids ok i did read the reviews which ranged from splendid to awful i took the plunge as i do like salty and tangy flavors no i had never had these before i took the leap and ordered a case at a super price they arrived quickly and in great shape with the sell by date feb 2011 umm im in the middle on these chips they are ok but not something i cant live without i love the crunch the color no trans fat they are a little too vinegary for my taste which is a lot coming from a kid that grew up eating pickled hardboiled eggs and pickled pigs feet br br i havent tried them with a deli sandwich and a cold mug of beer which might improve the experience this was the best deal ever the delivery was fast the chips are delicious and very fresh love it my husband and i love these chips personally i think the flavor is perfect try them for yourself the barbeque flavor of these chips is really perfect just spicy enough a hint of sweetness just a little smokey the chips themselves are extra crunchy and just thick enough to be substantial but not hard this makes for a wonderful snack or a great accompaniment for burgers hot dogs or brats chicken or just about any casual entree i was hesitant to buy this at my local grocery store lunds but they were on sale so i bought a bag ive found that going beyond the simplyflavored chips like cheddar or vinegar usually results in disappointment tried the thai or asianinspired chips by target archer farms and they were awful these kettle spicy thai chips are just awesome so much so that im considering buying them in bulk from amazon the taste is complicated and stimulates different parts of the palate the taste sensations prevalent in real thai food is baked into this chip sweet salty spicy was sour in there too i dont know but this is a wellmade wellbalanced chip that is addicting as a professional potato chip muncher i see these as thee very best on the market rich taste and flavor almost impossible not to finish the entire bagthe true meaning of decadence these are handsdown the absolute best salt vinegar chips you can buy they have a great strong flavor that has left me addicted these are certainly my favorite chips i highly recommend trying them oh i love these chips and theyre so hard to find where i am and when i do find them theyre usually 12 more per bag for less great that these are so cheap here at amazon i love these chips it is a little weird to review potato chips but these chips are great the crunch is just right plus they have just the right amount of salt not to salty not too bland they are a little oily but thats ok the best thing is the 2 oz package when i buy a larger bag its harder to resist eating them all this 2 oz package allows for a little portion control be sure to use your scissors to open cause these chips are packaged for freshness and dont open easily enjoy in the past couple years i have eaten and reviewed several kinds and styles of chips from the best ive ever had to big disappointments if you have eaten the lantchips varieties there is no way that they are not the best as a group the kettle chips are rightly salted and i was so irritated by some pringles products kettle has good flavor but the small size and overwhelming oiliness takes away from the flavors all in all its good to have choiceamazon does not stock the lantchips all the time so there are some days that there is no choice these chips are good and bad and create moral dilemmas constantly if wou are strong at will or having a large bbq go for it but as for me i was in the habit of bringing a new bag to work every three days had to put in a lot of time on the treadmill to make up for it beware kettle chips flavors can be hit or miss some of their flavors are terrible but this is very simple and delicious probably one of their best flavors br br pros thick crunchy potato chips with light salt that doesnt compromise on taste ecofriendly business that isnt just giving us lip service br br cons the occasional burnt chip and the bag is a pain to open they have a tab that you can pull down but most of the time i end up tearing down the entire side of the bag use scissors instead we bought these chips at a little sandwich shop in sonoma while we were on vacation i wasnt sure what to expect by the package and at first bite i didnt know what to think and then all of the flavors hit br yum they are a bit spicy but nothing overpowering just lots of crunchy sweet spicy goodness they arent sold everywhere though im still trying to find them somewhere close to where i live i have to admit that those chips are so good that they are highly addictive i cant stop eating them its crunchy and seasoned at the right amount of flavor and salt just perfect believe me some chips are so salty i cant finish a small bag but this one i just keep on eating these are some of the best chips that i have ever had they sure beat anything else out there and are even cooked in a way that is better for you than most other name brands they are tangy and crisp and satisfy any craving at the time these will be the only chips that i buy from now on and i thank amazon for letting me buy them online in bulk and save some money at the same time im addicted to salty and tangy flavors so when i opened my first bag of sea salt vinegar kettle brand chips i knew i had a perfect complement to my vegetable trays of cucumber carrot celery and cherry tomatoes skip the dip balance the tangy chips by alternating bites of raw vegetable br br as an oregonian im proud to share these delectable snacks with friends especially those living outside our state and who havent experienced gourmet chips i tell them kettle brand does for potato chips what microbrews did for beer br br kettle brand potato chips are unmistakablea light gold color rich flavor and amazing crunch kettle brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands kettle brand chips dont have trans fats msg or artificial flavors and colorings the company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified kosher br br i also recommend a href kettle chips honey dijon a and a href kettle chips spicy thai a br br annette solomon a reporter for the salem statesman journal recently noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with these chips solomon wrote you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing these chips are spicy so you would want to select a semisweet white wine also a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger lime garlic and cilantro without overpowering them classically a germanstyle riesling fits these parameters perfectly these honey dijon chips bring a terrific balance of salty tangy sweet and crunchy other brands ive tried use too much mustard flavor which overpowers the honey dijon pairing br br these chips make a great side dish on a bbq plate with baked beans coleslaw or potato salad and grilled meat naturally they also go down great with beer br br as an oregonian im

will subdue the strong flavors of ginger lime garlic and cilantro without overpowering them classically a germanstyle riesling fits these parameters perfectly these chips remind me of a long obsolete brand of chips we could get in middle school they are by far the tastiest chips ive had and its impossible to walk past the aisle without picking up the trademark blue bag and then putting the bag clip on the bag these are by far my favorite chips they are extremely crunchy similar to other kettle style chips but its the extreme vinegar flavor that differentiates these from lesser fried potato snacks ive tried several other brands of salt and vinegar and none of them come close they are good but need more cheese and wish they were krinkle cut i much prefer the salt pepper just for the krinkle cut they have a better texture all around this brand is much better than fritolay and a good price on amazon when you get free shipping these are similar to tims or zacks chips in that they are very crispy br br on a side note these are the hardest bags to open by hand i have to use a knife or scissors everytime it took a while to get used to these chips but they are pretty good and more healthy for you they sure were eaten all up by my family and friends these are delicious the 2 oz bags are a bit big for school lunches definitely more than a serving i recently tried this flavor brand and was surprised at how delicious these chips are the best thing was that there were a lot of brown chips in the bsg my favorite so i bought some more through amazon and shared with family and friends i am a little disappointed that there are not so far very many brown chips in these bags but the flavor is still very good i like them better than the yogurt and green onion flavor because they do not seem to be as salty and the onion flavor is better if you havent eaten kettle chips before i recommend that you try a bag before buying bulk they are thicker and crunchier than lays but just as fresh out of the bag we are always pleased with amazons packaging chips are never crushed or broken always fresh we really liked this brand flavor of chips very tasty these chips are some of the best ive tasted they are not filled with chemicals you taste the tangy vinegar as well as the potato not greasy perfectly crispy if you dont like salt and vinegar tanginess dont even bother to try these definitely have zip i love them my children and their friends love them even my 4 year old loves them these chips were a great deal kettle was having a special deal for the case of chips they are hard to find in vegas and are my favorite flavor shipping was very fast sooner than expected fantastic you can not beat this taste and you can not resist to it only one if you are spice lover eat at your own risk once i would open a bag i could not stop good and salty i dont eat many chips but these i love great buy and arrived quick and packed great expiration date is a ways away so i have awhile to enjoy them great natural potato flavor i love brown russet hardy flavor and these fit that description to a tee i simply fell in love with these chips and refused to share them with my friends my experience with a lot of cheesefavored chips has been too salty and a little over the greasy side but these ny cheddar from kettle really changed my mind thanks to amazon for great discounts and i dont have to buy them from the store anymore bought this box of chips as a fathers day gift because dad loves them they are very yummy and more substantial than regular chips these chips are quite tasty and the price is right packaged very well would buy again i like kettle chips but was really disappointed with this order because they were over cooked i bought a bigger sized bag from costco and the chips were all cooked perfectly so i dont know why these were different br will never buy these chips from here again for some reason amazon would not ship these to alaska so i sent them to my grandchildren who got to enjoy them they are very good chips amazon should rethink the shipping to alaska thing i would order groceries online my husband likes these a lot they are a bit different to get used to as they are less greasy and salty in taste than the usual chips you buy they are more browner than i would like to see and the chips are pretty sturdy in texture not bad though just takes getting used to eating chips better for your health they do have about 12 the calories in fat however just got this order and it is ok a bit light on the cheddar flavoring and herb taste eludes me if it is there i really love kettle brand chips but these are rather disappointing there is very little sour cream or onion flavor i took one and said good russet potato chip but i found that the flavoring was subtle for my taste a bit oily and overcooked it may be because i am use to eating their great tasting a href kettle chips spicy thai 2 ounce bags pack of 24 a or perhaps because all the chips in the bags i received were overcooked and that overpowered the seasoning it is obvious the chips are flavored but if i did not read the bag i would never have thought it had cheddar flavor and i love new york cheddar the flavoring included parmesan cheddar blue cheese garlic and other spices a good chip even when overcooked but i do not plan to buy them again i took one and said good russet potato chip but where is the flavoring then all of a sudden within seconds it spread to my senses and my taste buds were happy as close to thai food as a potato chip can get these chips are spicy enough to satisfy that craving for spice and a hint of sweetness that makes them habit forming the flavoring included garlic ginger jalapeno cilantro and other spices and it just felt great to eat these i will buy these again these were a treat i agree with the other review these chips are not for a sore mouth or tender gums the chips are very hard and the taste is delightful if you enjoy the salt vinegar combo unfortunately every bag i received in that case was over cooked they were very dark and only a few golden brown chips in each bag they definitely need to improve that we love kettle chips lightly salted and dont feel guilty eating them we used to buy them at whole foods but buying from amazon has saved us money we have purchased at least 3 times and have been happy with the chips and the delivery a friend of mine brought these into work with the claim these will change your life while my life is fairly unchanged i can not get enough of these chips and i do not even like kettle chips for the most part i find kettle chips to be too thick and greasy but the flavor of these chips is amazing the are the type of hot that is refreshing if you do not enjoy spicy or hot things try these anyway they may convert you but if you happen to like me there is no better sea salt and vinegar chip ive found in this country these are the best potato chips ive ever tasted its easy to go through half of a bag without stopping the texture crunchiness is just perfect as is the salt and vinegar combination i dont know how they taste so much better than all of the other chips ive ever had but they do and judging from the nutrition facts they seem to be healthier too theyre somewhat fibrous and have a good bit of potassium and vitamin c which could be because they dont skin the potatoes and the chips are a bit thicker than normal br br and if you like these all of the kettle chips are great i rarely eat chips but i saw these and tried them they are really amazing i love cheddar too but the chips are really thin and crunch and delicious flavor i recommend them this is easily the best potato chip that i have ever had look at the ingredients ginger and 3 types of hot pepper how can you go wrong br br obviously not for you if you dont like spicy food but if you do like spicy food youll probably love these they have that hotwithahintofsweetness flavor combo that is prevalent in a lot of thai food kettle chips spicy thai potato chips have the perfect amount of sweet savory and spicy everything youd want in a good meal or better yet a potato chip since these are kettlecooked the chips are uniquely shaped and are sometimes a bit overbrowned they are however sliced just perfectly not too thick not too thin so you can actually get a great crunch with each bite without breaking a tooth off the flavor is tremendous although i wouldnt describe it as thai its more of a vague sweet and tangy flavor with a kick and every now and then you get a great big hit of ginger if you like any spice at all these really are not overly spicy so most people can handle them the fact that these chips have absolutely no artificial ingredients or trans fat makes them a fabulous addition to any munchers snack cupboard okay i should not eat potato chips nor should anyone br but these are so spicy i would find it hard to eat br very many that makes them an indulgence that br rescues some people from overindulgence i dont write very many reviews but i have to say that kettle brand chips are the best i have ever tasted every flavor is dynamite if you are feeling iffy about honey dijon i would recommend cheddar beer absolutely amazing and theyre healthy besides a lil fat i have eaten a lot of chips in my day and kettle takes the cake enjoy and dont eat them too fast\n"

for the price and iam get one myself this offer be a great price and a great taste thank amazon for sell this product br br staral mccann instant oatmeal be great if you must have your oatmeal but can only scrape together two or three minute to prepare it there be no escape the fact however that even the good instant oatmeal be nowhere near as good as even a store brand of oatmeal require stovetop preparation still the mccann be as good as it get for instant oatmeal its even well than the organic allnatural brand I have try all the variety in the mccanns variety pack taste good it can be prepare in the microwave or by add boiling water so it be convenient in the extreme when time be an issue br br mccanns use of actual cane sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup help I decide to buy this product real sugar taste well and be not as harmful as the other stuff one thing I do not like though be mccanns use of thickener oats plus water plus heat should make a creamy tasty oatmeal without the need for guar gum but this be a convenience product maybe the guar gum be why after sit in the bowl a while the instant mccann become too thick and gluey this be a good instant oatmeal from the good oatmeal brand it use cane sugar instead of high fructouse corn syrup so not only do it have a well sweetness but some doctor now say that this form of sugar be well for you great on a cold morning when you do not have time to make mccanns steel cut oats the apple cinnamon be the good but the maple and brown sugar or the regular be good too plus they do not require doctor to actually tell the three flavor apart instant oatmeal can become soggy the minute the water hit the bowl mccanns instant oatmeal hold its texture have excellent flavor and be good for you all at the same time mccann regular oat meal be excellent too but may take a bit long to prepare than most have time for in the morning this be the good instant brand I ve ever eat and a very close second to the noninstant variety br br mccanns instant irish oatmeal variety pack of regular apple cinnamon and maple brown sugar 10 count box pack of 6 mccann instant irish oatmeal variety pack of regular apple cinnamon and maple brown sugar 10 count box pack of 6 br br I m a fan of the mccann steelcut oat so I think I d give the instant variety a try I find it to be a hardy meal not too sweet and great for folk like I postbariatric surgery who need food that be palatable easily digestible with fiber but will not make you bloat for those of we with celiac disease this product be a lifesaver and what could be well than get it at almost half the price of the grocery or health food store I love mccann instant oatmeal all flavor br br thank br abby what else do you need to know oatmeal instant make it with a half cup of lowfat milk and add raisin nuke for 90 second more expensive than kroger store brand oatmeal and maybe a little tasty or well texture or something its still just oatmeal mmm convenient I be visit my friend nate the other morning for coffee he come out of his storage room with a packet of mccanns instant irish oatmeal he suggest that I try it for my own use in my stash sometimes nate dose not give you a chance to say no so I end up try the apple and cinn find it to be very tastefull when make with water or powdered milk it go good with o j and coffee and a slice of toast and your ready to take on the world or the day at least jerry reith I order this for my wife as it be reccomende by our daughter she have this almost every morning and like all flavor she s happy I m happy br a href mccanns instant irish oatmeal variety pack of regular apple cinnamon and maple brown sugar 10 count box pack of 6 a the variety pack taste great br br I have they every morning at 030 cent per meal I do not understand why everyone on earth be not buy this stuff up br br maple and brown sugar be terrific follow by apple and cinnamon follow by regular you do not get tired of the same ole thing and they taste great br br I just boil water from a small pot empty the packet or 2 in a bowl pour in boiling water and watch it expand to 2x its size br br taste really good and take minute to prepare br br not sure why everyone on earth be not this convenient healthy very quick excellent quality and extremely cheap mccann make oatmeal for every oatmeal connoisseur whether one like it from the raw pellet state that cook for half an hour to the sloth addle instant which can be do in the microwave for under three minute its all good that s for sure and the beauty of the instant variety be that it be available in different flavor as well as regular br this variety pack allow different taste to be explore as well as give you a chance to experience the difference between mccann and other wellknown oatmeal what I personally like about mccann be that it cook up thick and with more body than the top brand here in america the apple cinnamon though tend to be a little liquidy so you may want to experiment with the amount of water you add in my 1300watt microwave the oatmeal cook up in about one minute and twentyseven second so you should also watch that to get a handle on how much time and water to use br the only bad thing if you can consider it a bad thing about this offering be that you have to buy in lot so you ll end up with six tencount box this be good if you have a whole family of oatmealeater but if you re a single person alone well love oatmeal I have mccann oatmeal every morning and by order it from amazon I be able to save almost 300 per box br it be a great product taste great and very healthy mccann oatmeal be a good quality choice our favorite be the apple and cinnamon but we find that none of these be overly sugary for a good hot breakfast in 2 minute this be excellent we really like the mccanns steel cut oat but find we do not cook it up too often br this taste much well to I than the grocery store brand and be just as convenient br anything that keep I eat oatmeal regularly be a good thing this seem a little more wholesome than some of the supermarket brand but it be somewhat mushy and do not have quite as much flavor either it do not pass muster with my kid so I probably will not buy it again good oatmeal I like the apple cinnamon the good though I would not follow the direction on the package since it always come out too soupy for my taste that could just be I since I like my oatmeal really thick to add some milk on top of the flavor be good however I do not see any differce between this and oaker oats brand they be both mushy I really like the maple and brown sugar flavor the regular be fine with brown sugar add the apple and cinnamon flavor be ok this be a very quick easy and satisfy breakfast and ill order this brand again but not the variety ill get all maple and brown sugar this be the same stuff you can buy at the big box store there be nothing healthy about it it be just carb and sugar save your money and get something that at least have some taste this oatmeal be not good its mushy soft I do not like it quaker oat be the way to go get a free package of these with a bottle

arrive in 6 day and be so stale I could not eat any of the 6 bag I have use the endurolyte product for several year in both pill and powder form long desert ride on the dirt bike always find my camelbak water heavily laced with the endurolyte powder not overly tasty but quite effective as I never get a cramp on these several hundred mile ride same for desert racing in the buggy the camelbak be always lace with the powder now we have the fizz what a great product firstly its hammer endurolyte product so its great endurance athlete the world over use their product second its convenient handly tablet that dissovle in a fizz third it taste great imagine get a nice cool drink when your body be starve for hydration and electrolyte and rather than get a salty taste you get a refreshing lemonlime or mango the camelbak always get the fizz now I also drop a tablet in my bottled water whenever I exercise and have a nice flavor water chock full of electrolyte I can not recommend this product or any hammer product highly enough this product serve I well as a source of electrolyte during and after a long run or bike ride br I have try all of the flavor but really do like the grapefruit flavor no aftertaste and I actually like the slight carbonation br I use other hammer product and really like their whole product line this stuff really work for prevent cramp during the middle to latter stage of your ride pop 1 into each water bottle and you re set flavor be fine and go down easy for those of we on a low carb diet these little tablet be just the thing br br two year ago I start cycle again after many year but be have heart arrhythmia after long ride in high heat I be drink plain water but do a little research and thought electrolyte might be the issue gatorade be not an option because it be so loaded with carbohydrate so I look around for a lowcarb alternative the zero carb sport drink do not help so what to do one day I run across these at my bike shop so try a tube of they voila problem solve br br I ve share they with two friend in particular whose problem with leg cramp be resolve while use these br br these guy get it right they be superbly formulate and simply work I purchase the mango flavor and to I it do not take like mango at all there be no hint of sweetness and unfortunately there be a hint or aftertaste almost like licorice I ve be consume various sport nutrition product for decade so I m familiar and have come to like the taste of the most of the product I ve try the mango flavor be one of the least appealing I ve taste its not terrible but its bad enough that I notice the bad taste every sip I take if you re impulsive like I then 6 be ok do not get I wrong the quality of these baby be very good and I have no complaint but in retrospect the price be a little ridiculous esp when you add on the shipping this be sooooo deliscious but too bad I eat em too fast and gain 2 pds my fault these albanese gummi bear and ring and so on be very good and tasty and high quality the bear even have little face at my local candy store this type of gummi stuff bear ring snake ball worm whatever be about 10 lb these twin pack of 45 or 5 pound bag be a scream deal as far as I m concerned I m probably 50 pound deep in these friggin thing consume grape gummy bear be hard to find in my area in fact pretty much anyone I talk to about grape gummy bear they think I m lie so I buy 10lb these bear be a little bit big then the other brand and have kind of sour kick but nothing to strong I love grape flavor candy soda and these be pretty good there be another company that make grape gummy bear that be a little bit well in my opinion but these be well worth it for the price I like to use the gummy bear in home make popsicle with flavor sport drink the salt in the sport drink make for soft popsicle and the gummy bear be awesome frozen they be delicious I order two of these and two of raspberry latice tart directly from fantasicake website for a dinner party I be host it arrive fresh and intact very good size I freeze half for later use I be a pastry lover and these be the good I ve ever taste the pastry be soft the jam be really good and the taste be great they be go in no time my guest be really impressed buyer beware please this sweetener be not for everybody maltitol be an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body you will know a short time after consume it if you be one of the unsuspecting many who can not digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramp and massive amount of gas a person can experience nausea diarrhea headache can also be experience I learn my lesson the hard way year ago when I fall in love with the sugarfree chocolate suzanne sommer use to sell I think I d find sugarfree chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss be short live when the terrible side effect of maltitol kick in the discomfort be unlike anything I have ever feel before I blow up like a balloon and have very painful abdominal cramping as the symptom pass this too be very unpleasant though hard for I to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit all symptom be go when I stop eat the chocolate my hunch it have something to do with the maltitol be unfortunately confirm for I about a year later when I purchase some delicious sugarfree popcorn at my local market the taste be amazing and while I be look at the label wonder what could possibly make this yummy new sugarfree treat taste so good my heart sink when I follow the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener down to the very bottom of the label and read maltitol in tiny little letter thank goodness i d eat only a little I still end up with all the same sideeffect but for a much short duration some people can use maltitol to their heart content but other like I can have a bad reaction to it in case you re like I its not you its the maltitol it be okay I would not go out of my way to buy it again no tea flavor at all just whole brunch of artifial flavor it be not returnable I waste 20 buck these look like a perfect snack to through in with my trail mix unfortunately they arrive in a solid mass of melt chocolate I leave they in my pantry for a few day and when I open they at room temperature they be still gooey I through they in the fridge and I ve be break off hunk ever since they taste good to I but the chocolate be all grainy after melt and then solidify again I will not order they online again but if I see they in a store I would pick they up these taste really good I have be purchase a different brand and these be very similar in taste and texture I agree with the other reviewer regard ordering in the summer there be no insulate packaging with ice pack so they will melt in warm weather like all chocolate food item order in cold weather and buy enough to last the taste be great but the berry have melt may order again in winter if you order in cold weather you should enjoy flavor I know I can not make tea this good grant I be not from the south but I know I have never enjoy tea that be this sweet without be too sweet it taste crisp this peppermint stick be delicious and fun to eat my dad get I one for christmas because he remember I have a similar one when I be a little girl I m 30 now and I love it great gift for all age I purchase these giant cane before and the recipient love they so much they keep they and would not eat they I know the product title say molecular gastronomy but do not let that scare you off I have be look for this for a while now not for food science but for something more down to earth I use it to make my own coffee creamer br br I have to have my coffee blonde and sweet but the flavor creamer be full of the bad kind of fat and honestly I hate to use manufactured food item I really do not think they be good for the body on the other hand I hate use cold milk or cream because I like hot coffee br br I stumble across this on amazon one day and get the idea of make my own creamer I also buy lowfat noninstant milk powder and regular milk powder the noninstant lowfat milk be a little sweet and taste fresher than regular instant lowfat milk but do not dissolve good in cold water which be not a problem for hot coffee you will have to play with the ratio I would not do just the heavy cream it make the coffee too rich also I think the powder be too expensive to just use on its own I like mix 13 of each together br br for flavor I bough cocoa bean powder vanilla bean powder and caster superfine sugar I mix up small batch along with spice like cinnamon and nutmeg to make my own flavor creamer if you want you could use a fake sweetner powder instead I make up small amount that I store in jelly canning jar I also use my little food chopper food processor to blend everything so the sugar be not heavy and sink to the bottom let it settle for a bit before open the top though br br this stuff taste way well than the storebought creamer and it be fun to experiment and come up with your own flavor I be go to try use some essential oil next and see if I can get a good chocolate orange mix br br all of the ingredient I mention be here online take the time to experiment maybe you do not use any lowfat milk or do not add any flavoring it be up to you also would make great housewarming host ess gift br br I be sure other molecular people will be able to tell you more of what you can do with it and I be sure I will experiment with it in cooking but the main reason I buy it be to make my own creamer and it work out great while my dog like all of the flavor that we have try of this dog food for some reason their itching increase when I try the lamb and rice I have some very itchy dog and be give they a limited ingredient dog food to try to help the duck and sweet potato cut down on the itching significantly but when we try lamb and rice they start itch more once again I like natural balance for the quality ingredient awesome dog food however when give to my boston who have severe reaction to some food ingredient his itching increase to violent jumping out of bed at night scratch as soon as I change to a different formula the scratching stop so glad natural balance have other choice I guess you have to try each until you find what s good for your pet we have three dog and all of they love this food we buy it specifically for one of our dog who have food allergy and it work great for he no more hot spot or tummy problem br I love that it ship right to our door with free shipping my dog have a ton of allergy both environmental and food she be on a prescription dog food before we have she test to see what allergy she have after we get the test back we learn she be allergic to something in the prescription brand so I finally find this dog food and she have do so well on this she still have her environmental trigger but I be happy she can finally eat something I know will not cause her pain my shepherd collie mix have ib our vet recommend a limited ingredient food this have really help her symptom and she like it I will always buy it from amazon its 10 cheap and free shipping natural balance dry dog food lamb meal and brown rice recipe do wonder for my jack russell she have awful food allergys and this food be our last hope because it be the last food we could find that do not have something in it that she be allergic to she have no problem eat it dry but normally I mix the natural balance dry lamb and brown rice with the natural balance wet lamb and brown rice she seem to like that well we start feed it to our other dog a bichon too and she love it if your dog have allergys or stomach issue or if you want your dog to eat well food this be it you will see a difference in your pet great food I love the idea of one food for all age breed ã \\x8e ts a real convenience as well as a really good product my 3 dog eat less have almost no gas their poop be regular and a perfect consistency what else can a mom ask for I have a standard poodle and pomeranian who both do wonderful on this food I have switch they to a different food due to price a couple of time and end up go right back to natural balance this be great dog food my dog have sever allergy and this brand be the only one that we can feed he this food be great all age dog I have a 3 year old and a puppy they be both so soft and hardly ever get sick the food be good especially when you have amazon prime ship my golden retriever be one of the most picky dog I ve ever meet after experiment with various type of food I have find she love natural balance what I really like about natural balance be the fact that it have multiple flavor in dry and wet variety I mix her dry food with a little wet food and my golden love it furthermore I do like mix up the flavor each time as I think the same meal day over day might get a little boring so I figure why not I tend to stay away from the fish type though as it smell br br additionally I start purchase off amazon because petco do not have the wet food box and only have a couple of can I come home and to my surprise realize that I could save 20 each time I buy dog food if I just buy it off amazon br br all in all I definitely recommend and give my stamp of approval to natural balance dog food while I have never eat it my dog seem to love it this be the same food we get at pet store but its deliver to my door and for the same price or slightly less I ve be very pleased with the natural balance dog food our dog have have issue with other dog food in the past and I have someone recommend natural balance grain free since it be possible they be allergic to grain since switch I have not have any issue it be also helpful that have have different kibble size for large small sized dog my 11 2 year old basenji jack russell mix love this dog food he s be noticeably healthy and more energetic since I switch he over from the standard dog food early this year despite the high cost of natural dog food I find that he eat significantly less of the natural balance dog food and still stay happy and full on the normal dog food he d eat up to 3 cup of dog food a day the recommend serve for his size whereas he only eat about 1 cup to 11 2 cup of the natural balance dog food a day when you take this into account you re actually get more bang for your buck with the natural dog food since you do not have to buy as much to last just as long as the normal dog food and a healthier happy dog to boot add in the fact that you can get free 2 day ship with amazon prime I m sell our pup have experience allergy in form of hotspot and itching from other dog food the cheap you can buy it anywhere food not only have crazy preservative in they but can cause health problem for your pet this food work wonder on reduce allergy and our dog love the food br this message be ramsey frankenstein approve my english bulldog have skin allergy the summer we get he at age 3 the vet recommend we wean he off the food his previous owner give he iams lamb and rice and onto a new kind this be the second one we try and it have be work ever since its for dog that need a limited diet who can be sensitive to additive and protein commonly find in commercial dog food like chicken or beef I feed this to my golden retriever and he hate it he would not eat it and when he do it give he terrible diarrhea we will not be buy this again its also super expensive the mouth say how do I love thee let I count the way br if you like apple product a must have item the only draw back shipping cost these be very heavy arrive slightly thaw my parent would not accept it however the company be very helpful and issue a full refund the crust on these tart be perfect my husband love these but I m not so crazy about they they be just too sour tart for my taste ill eat the crust and hubby take my fill my kid think they re great so maybe its just I these be absolutely scrumptuous my husband and I both love they however as another customer put it they be expensive to ship the cost of shipping be more than the tartlet themselves be what a nice alternative to an apple pie love the fact there be no slicing and dice easy to prepare I also love the fact that you can make they fresh whenever need I like creme brulee I love that these be so easy just sprinkle on the sugar that come with and broil they look amazing and taste great my guess think I really go out of the way for they when really it take all of 5 minute I will be order more not what I be expect in term of the company reputation for excellent home delivery product I first buy pickled asparagus at an amish market and it be love at first bite hence when I see these on the discount rack at the local safeway I clean it out these be even well than the one from the amish market they be fantastic and some of the jar have a bonus clove of garlic at the bottom I m go to order the six pack and I m a household of one they will not go to waste I love asparagus up until very recently I have never have pickle asparagus oh my goodness when a friend introduce I to this exact brand I could not believe how great stuff taste I love it so much I buy the six pack I ve get 2 jar leave go to need more I m presently on a diet and I be at my fresh and easy neighborhood grocery look over possible diet food I want thing that be tasty nonfat and low in calorie I come home with about a dozen item that s how I discover the tillen farm pickle crispy asparagus well I ve always like asparagus anyway and I ve enjoy several brand of pickled asparagus this tillen farm brand be really really good its the good I can recall there s an excellent flavor and a big clove of garlic down in the bottom of the jar which I m look forward to eat I can not believe how good this asparagus taste and right on the front it say only 60 calorie per jar now this be my idea of a good diet food br br gary peterson I be diappointe in the flavor and texture of this mix I usually like most of the low carb thing I have try but be diappointe in this specific one I have be drink this tea for a long time now I use to have to purchase it at a doctor office because it be not available elsewhere I m so glad that I can buy it now from amazoncom I drink this tea throughout the day like other folk drink coffee wonderful taste I have be drink royal king 100 natural organic green tea 100 tea bag x 2 g each as my every day tea for several year now I buy 12 box at a time to save on shipping for many year I use to drink coffee from morning till night but finally I realize that drink so much coffee be not healthy for I I finally resolve to improve my health and stop drink coffee all together I try many alternative drink to replace my coffee habit I find that green tea be not only good tasting it also have health benefit green tea be one of the few drink that actually make you healthy coffe and other drink do not the only healthy drink be quality cold water in my opinion for the price royal king 100 natural organic green tea be one of the well taste tea this green tea have a beautiful golden color the taste be bright and fresh I recommend add a tiny amount of y s organic bee farm raw honey to the tea to add sweetness and health benefit too I also give myself a treat once in a while by have a much more expense tea tribute xi hu long jing but this fantastic tea be not practical for I to drink as my every day tea although I would if I could afford it br br con on my late shipment the package show on the amazon page be different than the one ship the one ship display naturally high in polyphenol catechin a key contributive element to the possible health effect of tea whereas the amazon package display caffene free so I be not sure if this green tea be caffene free or not the other con be that sometimes the tea bag rip open when I unwrap the string from around the tea bag so if the string seem stuck to the tea bag I put the bag in the hot water to unstick it this have to be one of the good tea I have ever taste its clean bright fresh br br great delivery again quality just try it I love love this green tea it be very hard to find in our area and some place on the internet charge a big price and I usually do not get as many box as I do with this merchant I will definitely order from this seller again thank I depend on my green tea fix everyday I love this tea it help curb my eating during the day my mom and I have give it all friend to try I m italian and I live in italy for year I use to buy these cookie for my everyday breakfast with an italian espresso I could not find they anywhere here in the bay area so its great to have they again in the 1980 I spend several summer in italy this biscotti be often give as a breakfast food or midday snack they be simple and delicious and be not sell in the us back then they be so good that I bring back two bag from a recent trip to italy it be great to see that they may now be find on amazon br br note it be great to open a bag smell the content pour a glass of milk then dip the macine in the milk great routine and treat for kid I have hear a little about this product from the local pet store then try a small bag for our 2 cat of about 3 and 6 year respectively the female young one take to it right away and the old male who be unfortunately wean on the junk cat food with all the corn meal and etc in it and would usually refuse a diet change actually like it too the old male be overweight and we be try to switch he to soft food on the doctor request but he totally refuse it he be a posh cat after all he still consume too many calorie the fatty but at least I know he s eat good food of course I know this product seem to cost more than most other feline food on the market but I just can not see feed our animal the lousy alternative that be out there market as be healthy why do commercial show cat eat a vegetarian diet which be mostly corn meal be that right ill stay with this for now but stay tune br br I m update this review after 9 month of use this cat food for our two cat I upgrade the star from 4 to 5 as it really have be a good food for the two of they garfield still eat a little too much but he s just a big cat who do not exercise much let face it our female cat will be 4 year old in a couple month and she s so healthy she s tiny but happy and agile I try the chicken version of holistic select but garfield seemd to miss this sardine version so we go back to this one I ve order the duck version and will update this once they try it I start buy this after I notice my 1 year old cat be already start to lose his spunk so I decide it be time to start buy he real cat food not the garbage in the super market I find this at the pet store out of the other million choice and I m sure there be other brand that be just as good but this be the one I go with to try first and it be a great purchase my cat have be on this for the past 8 month and he s now just have active as he be when he be a kitten and his coat have become sooo soft mainly he love the taste even more I highly recommend this brand to all my friend and family for their animal I have do a lot of research to find the good food for my cat and this be an excellent food that be also accord to my holistic veterinarian they put probiotic on the kibble as the last step which be very important to I the good thing be that my cat love it immediately and I have to stop mix it with the old food because she only would eat holistic select this cat food be recommend by my vet because my 13 year old cleo cat be have trouble keep any food down and be loose weight it stop her problem she do not eat as much as before since she seem to be more satisfied after eat which help justify the add price it aid in digestion since the ok sorry smell be go if ya know what I mean have to add that so anyone experience problem with their cat can see there be a lot of benifit from this cat food I have a 4 year old male cat who have chronic urinary tract infection I feed he this dry food in combination with wet food with water add to it and uri ease the combination seem to keep his utis under control if I switch to another type of dry food his uti get bad the other cat seem to enjoy this food as well its expensive but it seem to be the good solution for I before I be educate about feline nutrition I allow my cat to become addicted to dry cat food I always offer both canned and dry but wish I would have feed they premium quality can food and limited dry food I have two 15 year old cat and two 5 year old cat the only good quality dry food they will eat be wellness and innova innovas manufacturer be recently purchase by procter gamble I begin look for a replacement after once again offer several sample from my local holistic pet store holistic select be the only one other than the usual wellness and innova they would eat for finicky cat I recommend try holistic select it be a good quality food that be very palatable for finicky eater my holistic vet recommend this along with a few other brand we try they all but my cat prefer this especially the sardine version the good part be their coat be so soft and clean and their eye be so clear and and I do not want to be rude so ill say this as delicately as I can their waste be far less odorous than cat who eat the mcdonald junk find in most store which be a definite plus for I the health benefit be so obvious I highly recommend holistic select one of my cat be allergic to fish and beef this formula be one of the few she can eat and it have much well ingredient than the prescription diet available at the vet both of my kitty be very active have soft shiny fur and neither be fat dry food reduce tartar buildup on tooth also our cat thrive extremely well on this dry cat food they definitely have much less hair ball throw up and their fur be great they be fit and not over weight this vendor ship extremely fast be one of the top amazon supplier in our book I ve be a fan of hot spicy maruchan raman for a long time if you enjoy spice and love raman you ll love this product too bad its way too expensive here on amazon its only 336 per 12 at my walmart I ve be eat raman noodle since I be a little kid and I ve never find a well flavor than hot spicy chicken it be not hot at all to a chilihead like I but it sure be good I love spicy raman but for whatever reason this thing burn my stomach badly and the burn sensation do not go away for like 3 hour not sure if that be healthy or not and you can buy this at walmart for 028 way cheap than amazon always be a fan of raman as a quick and easy meal find it on amazon for a decent price and have it deliver to your door by the case be an amazing situation for anyone to find themselves in I must be a bit of a wuss because this soup taste to I how I imagine fire might taste typically I like spicy food if it have a good flavor I do not find this to be the case with this soup any flavor be kill off by the burn I really love the spicy flavor these have I find myself like the broth more than the noodle which be usually the opposite if you be not use to the heat this might bother you and if you like hot hot food this might not be enough get these on sale for roughly 25 cent per cup which be half the price of my local grocery store plus they rarely stock the spicy flavor these thing be a great snack for my office where time be constantly crunch and sometimes you can not escape for a real meal this be one of my favorite flavor of instant lunch and will be back to buy every time it go on sale I have buy allot of different flavor and this happen to be one of my favorite and will be get more soon I love this flavor of raman I do not eat other flavor anymore because they taste too bland by comparison for the convenience of have it deliver to my home I have prime so I get it in two day and do not have to pay for the shipping the price on amazon be not bad at all but it be still cheap to run down and pick up a case of this at the grocery store the good investment I ve ever make for ginger its unbelievable its fibrous like the real ginger have that spicy kick to it but its perfect with the sugar calm it down its very worth the 40 for 5lbs of it ill be get more soon I use these as a topper for my ginger cupcake and cookie delicious I can not get australian ginger where I live this compare favorably to australian ginger I ve purchase in other city now I can enjoy it without travel I keep try other brand cheap brand stupid I this ginger be soooo worth the money tender moist and never a let down my son have have acid reflux since birth and have be on every medication available with no improvement until an old gentleman come into his work place and tell he about this product and I automatically order it for he I be really not expect any well result than the 1000 other thing we have try what a surprise he have not have any heartburn or symptom since day 2 of start eat one piece of this ginger each morning he can now eat anything and actually enjoy it this product be a god send for he thank you all for it I buy this for our office to give people something sweet to snack on because its bite size its easy for people to grab a couple a piece rather than an entire licorice stick my only complaint be that one of the bag break open in shipping twizzler brand licorice be much well than that other well know brand br if you can get these for 2 to 250 a package with free s h its a good deal br the black and cherry have good taste but the strawberry taste be too delicate and barely there I love these very tasty infact I think I be addicted to they br buy they in pack of 6 bag be very reasonable than go to target and get a bag saving be about a 100 a bag I use subscribe and save on these and several other product I love subscribe and save if you be look for a less messy version of licorice for the child then be sure to try these they re soft easy to chew and they do not get your hand all sticky and gross in the car in the summer at the beach etc we love all the flavos and sometimes mix these in with the chocolate to have a very nice snack great item great price too highly recommend I might be mistake but it appear that the piece in this bag be reduce in size if they do do that it be doubtlessly do to make it appear that the buyer get a well deal have so many piece after all the problem be that the piece have to be a certain size in order to have enough flavor for your eating experience as it be you have to use 2 or 3 piece to match the old piece size it be not the same be a fan of newmans pineapple salsa for quite a while I be look for a comparable salsa this be one of the good tasting salsa I ve ever have my daughter love it too they do not like super chunky salsa and the berry mango have a nice smooth texture with small mango piece the salsa be not too sweet just sweet enough and although its mild it have a nice little kick to it at this price its a steal the salsa smelled delicious as I think it probably be but unfortunately the person at amazon that be a packer there be probably several have very little stuff to work with especially on the bottom therefore the bottom be break on all three bottle as I reach for my computer I be tell no return cause its a food item I then look for a customer service tag and I find none on their new face lift they seem to be proud of their new face lift but they should at least have a place to contact they in emergency like I buy a lot of stuff and it all come in styrofoam box never would I ship thing br especially salsa in a cardboard box with just a stripe of large bubble wrap on it no matter how much the carrier fed ex be careful its go to break somewhere along the line especially in an all glass container barbara l s this be one of the good salsa that I have find in a long time but stay away from the variety pack the other two that come with it be not worth your money these remind I of dog treat I make once use pumpkin and cinnamon they re kind of bland and not my favorite back to nature product but my finace really love they so that s where the three star come from this be the good cornmeal I make regular cornbread and hot water cornbread with this meal and both be outstanding also fry some oyster with this meal it give they a great texture and flovor this be a fabulous marinade I love to use it for chicken either bake in the oven or on the grill this have enough flavor flair I ve even use it for dinner party only to receive rave review from my guest definitely worth the price super cheap and super easy love it work with chicken fish beef or pork fast easy and make it taste excellent plus buying in bulk be more than 50 off from box store get this for my brother who be on jorge cruise diet and decide to try one for myself it actually taste pretty good these single sell for 250 336 at the store for 1 box of 24 single I m not sure why amazon be sell it for 999 for a box of 24 single hazelnut coffee creamer be my favorite but truly this be not a good buy awesome such a yummy flavor I get it as a healthy alternative to the dessert we normally eat and I be so glad that I do there be so many thing you can

I reorder on amazon every month or so br edit add a short video so you see what this combination look like br br I be wear one of those headlamp but I do not do a good job focus on the tuna br I should film it over but it do not look like many people view this product anyway I ve never hear of the safcol brand before but I be tired of only try the typical pouch starkist and chicken of the sea I be really surprised as I think it be a bit well than the other brand and with less season these be the good tasting tuna pack they make in my opinion make a great on the go snack and really satisfy with the tomato I have always purchase starkist tuna but think I would try this brand for a change of pace the taste of the tuna be not pleasant too much basil and other spice for I I m not familiar with the safcol brand but be a tuna addict give this a shot the tuna taste like its good quality but I find the tomato basil flavor to be a bit bland its well than something plain but it do not pack the punch I be hope for its still a great option for a low calorie low fat meal I find it much tasty than the plain tuna pouch out there excellent quality and no need to dress it up br br I put it the micro on about 20 power for 1 minute and shazam br br I believe a little heating bring out the flavor seriously this product be as tasteless as they come there be much well taste product out there but at 100 calorie its well than a special k bar or cookie snack pack you just have to season it or combine it with something else to share the flavor I read about pomegranate molasse so I have to try it I have not make anything with it yet just eat a little bit at a time but wow be it decadent its dark syrupy sour and a little sweet a dab of this and I forget about dessert its just a really unique flavor with a pleasing metallic undertone yum I m go to try make fesenjan next use this in moroccan recipe as a syrup in a brilliant mixed beverage and as a swirl topping on sliced orange soak in orange water wonderful wonderful stuff I do not know how long these sit on the back of a shelf somewhere but they be so old that they would not cook I have to throw half of they out because the skin be damage a clear sign of dry bean past their prime I can not even return these or ask for a refund because food be not returnable will find a different brand to use for now I have about fifty serving of bean to throw away besides be small than runt they look the same and have the same consistency unfortunately they taste nothing like banana runt nor do they even taste good yucky stuff try to

sweet flavor pair the cake with your morning coffee and you ve get the perfect breakfast treat I use to love these grow up and stop drink water and lemon juice from this brand about 56 year ago this stuff use to be so strong I use to just pour some in my mouth and get that alive feeling go it feel like the product go through change which add more water or something to make it not so strong the strong it be the less you use as well the product be still really good but the taste be the same quality as the cheap brand name almost I think these would go fast but hey all lemon stuff I love unless it go bad this be a good product just wish it still have that hit I in the mouth chug sensation it use to be like one of the good lemon juice that I have try I be recur customer due to the high quality of this product when the season for fresh lemos be out this one supplement our need for the citrus on the kitchen or refreshment br br I will continue buy it this lemon juice be a must in my kitchen yearround it have a powerful flavor and you do not need much of it to zest up a dish I add a spritz of it to my water nearly every day br br I will buy this product again and again fast delivery and good product this be the same lemon juice concentrate you can find in store and its really handy to have around to add to sauce dressing etc such a pain to squeeze fresh juice everytime you need it nevermind have the lemon on hand to begin with this be not as good as the frozen lemon juice but it be good it have a slightly odd flavor perhaps from a preservative sure wish I could order the frozen juice could not believe it when tell how relax this beverage be seriously drink it only if you be get ready for a nap or bedtime if you have plan to drive or perform any other activity not recommend br br I feel my arm and leg almost tingle with relaxation after a short time my eye start to get droopy and I be in another place br br love this stuff I buy these at grocery outlet here in the seattle tacoma be for 400 a case of tweleve not pay 3800 yes 3 for a dollar I like the taste not great but not bad either low calorie will buy more but not at this whack out price this be an great product the taste be great and it work exactly as describe superb natural sleep aid amazing we have be look for natural way to help we sleep since we always seem to be overload with stress and a busy schedule yes we d probably be well serve take a yoga class but this be a good second choice this help you fall asleep and stay asleep I drink half the first night and that be plenty for I after about 30 minute I be ready for bed I wake up refresh and with no sleepydrug hangover so that be a huge bonus br br I give the product 3 star instead of the 5 it deserve as their packing job be marginal at good the product arrive with 2 broken bottle which at this price be a 6 loss the bottle be glass and all they do be wrap one layer of the smallbubble bubble wrap around the case and place it in a large box with extra room to move around in that box big packing fail but the product be awesome we make chocolate chip cookie with brm garbanzo bean flour and the result be fantastic the brown sugar and chocolate mask any bean taste that other review have mention our friend could not discern any difference from classic cccs the texture body and elasticity mean reduce tendency to fall apart that occur with most other glutenfree flour be nice and chewy the same as cccs make with regular flour and an add bonus the high protein and fiber level I calculate 23 g fiber cookie fill you up so that you be satisfied with small serving and the glycemic index be significantly low br br I highly recommend this flour even if cccs be the only thing you make with it this be great stuff make some really tasty banana bread good quality and low price in town we have trouble find this locally delivery be fast no more hunting up and down the flour aisle at our local grocery store this packet of glaze be the secret to make those european style fresh fruit tart I be about to make one for a pie auction at church after a friend request that something strawberry should be offer you can make the most amazing and relatively healthy fruit tart by bake a base layering it with uncooked fresh sliced fruit then pour over the madeup content of one of these packet they harden up at room temperature hold the fruit together so you can slice the tart and they let the beauty of the arrange fruit show through I ve also see this glaze use over cheesecake to hold a fruit topping in place personally I do not like cheesecake too rich for I but a fruit glaze cheesecake be gorgeous I will admit to do this slice fruit and layer it on the cheesecake while its still in the springform pan pour on the glaze let it set up and then remove the springform you ll have a clear layer of fruit on top of the cheesecake cherry strawberry or slice mango be nice but the good one I ever have use thin slice of lemon that have be gently poach in sugar syrup before they be layer on the cake br br I use a base of sponge cake bake in a shallow form but other basis can be pate sucre a kind of french pastry that be a bit like a sugar cookie that work well in those flute straightside form you can also make minitart in a muffin pan prebake each mold with a layer of pie crust even commercial crust work though again I prefer pate sucre it hold its shape well and be more substantial and have a well crumb just blindbake the muffin tin line with pate then pop they out and fill with fresh fruit berry be great and pour over the glaze some people put a layer of creme patisserie which be a pastry cream like custard but stabilize with flour below the fruit and I happen to think these taste good br br if you get into bake this glaze be a musthave on the shelf the ingredient be vegan tapioca starch carrageenan dextrose cream of tartar locust bean gum so if you be look to make a vegan tofu cheesecake you can use this on top as well as use it for fruit tart with a nut crust base my scottie be full of hot spot and when I use this within a week all the hot spot be go the smell be kinda strong but not bad its tolerablel I buy this coffee because its much cheap than the ganocafe and have the organic reishi mushroom as well as other healthy antioxidant I do not expect it to taste good but it actually do I ve only have it for a few day and for 5 its totally worth it my sister all take ganocafe but now I m introduce they to this less expensive similar coffee I will follow up on this product in a few week the coffee be very finely process and the flavor be just alright nescafe and mount hagen be well I buy this to try something other than these two but I probably will not get this again there be just a slight vitaminy taste but its not overwhelm its also a bit pricey for what you get this coffee be great because its all organic ingredient no pesticide to worry about plus it taste good and you have the healing effect for ganoderma like the other people mention this coffee have a great taste I ve try different instant coffee before but this one be one of the well one another one of my favorite if you want to try it out though not organic be africafe pure instant coffee taste great and give I energy without the jitter love this product br however I do wish it come in some sort of resealable jar or hard plastic container instead of a ziplock pouch because the ziplock rip off and quit work after awhile but the product be fantastic just not crazy about the packaging these little guy be tasty and refreshing br br I usually eat salad for lunch which can do terrible thing to breath I eat 2 of these after lunch because they be so small and I find this sufficiently resolve the problem br br they re sugar free sugar can actually help the smelly bacteria grow which be great and they re tasty enough that I almost think of they as part of my lunch br br this be a good bulk value buy and i d highly recommend the mint themselves cheer I like these well than the regular altoid but they re even more costly so you d well like they these little tin of sugar free mine mint be a great dealthere perfict for on the gofifty mint per tin be just the right amount to cary alongand there safe for your tooth than the one with sugarthe price of twelve dollar be very resonablealso there great for shareingif you be look for a mint try these onesyoull be glad you do pro br packaging shipping price br sell about a year before its expiration date enough for I to eat share 9 box br not too fresh like the regular wintergreen and not in a powdery form its a real mint br br con none be careful not to eat too many of they in one day as one of the chemical in it be the same as that of a laxative lololol these mint be really strong and have a great taste they be also a convenient size to carry in a pocket or purse this be a huge supply of they I m still work on these and have plenty to spare much more effective than buy one from the grocery store or 711 every time you want a mint even with small container they do not fill they up these little tin be less than half fill and at the price charge it seem a ripoff be there some exotic ingredient as costly as gold contain in those tiny square or how about the cereal ploy they be fill at the factory but settle in transport br can manufacturer be honest in their dealing I love and use the empty container for medicine advil in my purse desk suitcase also line with felt to keep earring perfect little size to disguise small valuable when travel and love the mint tiny and powerful without burn my mouth receive as show my mother in law like these and walgreen quit carry they it be great I could get they on amazon I keep a case of these in my office and always have at least a tin or two on my desk for visitor to help themselves to some folk stop by just to grab some mint and other pop they like candy while we meet when I find someone who keep come back for more I just give they their own tin one coworker ask I to save the tin for she so she could use they as pillbox and safety pin box like I say they re a real hit since I would not be able to keep my hand off a candy dish this be a good alternative to have around and its nice to have they around if I have garlic for lunch I give the item 4 star because they be not as tasty as the sugar version of the mint but what sugar free item be as good as its full sugar counterpart and because of the fact that each tin be wrap in plastic which seem like a waste and be irritate to remove although I totally get why they wrap it it still do not make it easy to deal with the tiny altoid be great for a quick breath freshen and the small box be great for portability its full but compact br br I have not run out yet and probably will not for a couple month but I can not wait to buy it again I love these wintergreen altoid small so much I have to come write a review the packaging be small for convenience and the altoid be small as well with a square shape blue hue and even more delicious taste in my opinion I definitely prefer they over the regularsize altoid and will continue purchase they highly recommend fresh scent and taste easy to eat one tin in few hour I use they as favor and everyone love they hard to find the wintergreen small sugar free as store only have the red small peppermint such a common flavor the wintergreen be refreshing and absolutely delicious driving cross country if someone cut I off I turn to my daughter with my hand out and say wintergreen I she pull one out put it in my hand and all be right with the world to I these be nothing like the regular altoid and be not breath mint they be pleasanttaste little candy in a cute convenient tin and that s as far as it go the mintiness be just not strong and the wintergreen be definitely weak than the peppermint mini I m not a dragonbreath person but still one of these mint be too small to have any effect on my breath four or five will freshen my breath for a short while maybe 15 minute at this point I think the icebreaker frost mint be the good as sugar free breath mint we have feed our cat a lot of stuff these 2 boy cat be not picky eater they love the purina they love the nutro they love the iam they love whatever we feed they br br this review be base on what we their affectionate owner love after a certain age we be instruct by the vet to consider senior food and low carb food because the cattie be fatty we try a few type of food some evince no change some make the litter superstink some have too small a kibble and the cat barf it up because they do not have to chew it to swallow it br br this felidae have do the trick no problem to speak of it be consistent in the litter and bearable on the nose the cat love it the kibble be size appropriate to chew and here the kicker br after feed the cat felidae their demeanor improve their coat be super soft and lush both be new improvement we can directly attribute to this food be now loyal felidae consumer br br additionally the absence of corn product in the feed seem to lessen or remove the reaction of our friend with catallergie I start my cat on felidae platinum about 3 week ago and she love it she s an old cat somewhat overweight and have a grouchy temperament I first mix it with her previous food and she figure out which be which she eat the felidae and leave the old food she s now be on just the felidae for about ten day now off the old food entirely and she be a much sweet happy cat I think it must agree with her well or be more easily digest or something in any case I be a happy purchaser of felidae I do not agree with the previous reviewer that cat do not like it clearly mine do we have three cat the young be about eleven year old another be fifteen and our old be well ancient that be what the vet tell we ten year ago the young be a blob when he lay down he look like a footstool the other two be arthritic and skinny br br since we have such success with canidae platinum for senior dog I figure that we d give it a try for our cat I d have they on low ash purina one urinary tract formula for their entire life and thankfully we have no ut problem br br buster the young be still a blob after six month plus on felidae for senior and overweight cat however the other two be now much more active and we can tell that they be really feel well since we change their food to felidae even prissy the ancient one have start to play and tease the dog by get they to chase she where before when she be on purina one all she want to do be to sleep br br I think that if you can get your cat on this fairly early in their weight problem it ll be more effective br br however the glucosamine will certainly help your old fur ball have a happy life too much of a good thing we work this kibble in over time slowly shift the percentage of felidae to national junkfood brand until the bowl be all natural by this time the cat could not keep it in or down what a mess we ve move on as with canidae felidae have also change their formula cat do not like change when it come to their food and they just have to change it without put it on their label we notice the color of the food have change and so do the smell as you will notice I have also reviewd the canidae and this all happen the same time the dog be have issue br br prior to the change in food we have almost lose two of our cat because we have move to a new home if cat get upset because of a change in enviorment or a loud noise they can stop eat it depend on the cat two of they have stop eat and have lose a lot of weight we take they to the vet and it take month to get they back to normal it have be a year since then and they be well then the formula for this food change br br we start to noitce they be not eat as much and it start to bug we we ask the shop owner of the feed store and she have no knowledge of any change to the food it be not until the we be in there with other customer yell about their dog food make their dog sick right away we change the cat food and they start chowe down and have not suffer one bit like our dog have br br cat be sensitve animal and change to thier food could cause they to stop eat anyone think of purchase this food should not do it we have 5 rescue and fix cat none of which be picky eater and the change in this formula could have be the death of they have we not find out about the change in their formula br br I urge anyone that have have these problem to go to the consumer affair website and also the fda website and write a letter to they to let they know how this have affect your animal as with canidae they do not care how the change have affect my animal and tell I not to buy it this be just horrible do not buy just a few of these I order these by the case I can not even remember the first time I taste an anchovy stuff olive but I have try several of the brand online and this brand be my favorite I order these olive a lot they be unlike any other olive out there the subtle flavor of the brine go great with cheese one of my favorite appetizer treat for guest hey the description say 360 gram that be roughly 13 ounce at under 400 per can no way that be the approximate price for a 100 gram can my husband and I be both kind of wimpy when it come to hot thing and this seasoning be just a bit too spicy for we it definitely make you sweat a bit when you re eat it it be still edible to we by add a good sized dollop of sour cream but I do not think I would buy it again due to the heat we prefer the milder mccormick brand of fajita mix I ve also have fajita in a couple of different restaurant and it be not as spicy as this mix be br br if you like super spicy then this be not burn hot so you might want to keep that in mind to I it be more than medium hot but not by too much br br I give it three star because it be pretty easy to make and its versatile in that you could vary the veggie you put in it you take a plastic bag a couple of tbs of vegetable oil 14 cup water and mix the seasoning water and oil together then add the chicken strip to the bag and let it marinate for 5 minute in the meantime it say to stir fry your veggie pepper and onion but I find it easy to just cook the chicken and veggie together and I do not think it affect quality or taste I also use extra virgin olive oil rather than vegetable oil br br I have one more package of this to use and next time I m go to add more veggie and maybe some chop tomato to cut the heat a bit more a friend who d be drink tea for 80 of his 84 year introduce I to this tea a few month ago even take I over to the store and buy I a pound at 7 lb in a retail store or a little over 9 with shipping from an online merchant I think its great I ve be drink earl grey english breakfast irish breakfast lapsang souchong assam etc most of they be over 30 lb with shipping aside from the lapsang souchong I think this be a great replacement for all the rest have everything I m look for in a strong fullbodie black tea with enough character to keep it from become bore my current favorite afternoon tea unless you re extremely jade or a tea snob you ll love it I love strong full bodied quality tea and typically drink assam irish breakfast or early grey tea but as the other reviewer note the price per pound can be discourage so I have be search for a quality full bodied tea that be not bitter at a more palatable price point and this certainly fit the bill and unlike some other tea where they tend to be well in one form or another I e ice vs hot this tea be excellent in both form I would certainly recommend this to anyone who prefer that smooth full bodied quality tea that do not cost an arm and leg I drink this tea plain without sugar or milk and it have a pleasant aroma br br the price from amazon be cheap than my local grocery store one reviewer be right I think it have some herbal smell to make up the aroma so the label imperial blend kind of imply the herb br br I be not exactly a black tea drinker so this tea be a surprise and affordable too I usually prefer white chinese tea like white peony but it be more expensive and require low temperature water but this be black tea and this aroma kind of remind I the softness of white tea I ve try a variety of ahmad tea not because I particularly like this brand but they be just easy to come across the imperial blend I believe be the most complex yet well balanced of all the one I ve try its full body like a good cup of assam which by no means overpower the delightful clean taste of darjeerling complete with a long lasting note of bergamot I enjoy it well in the evening it give a satisfying and relax finish to a busy day br br for those interested in the specific I use about 3 teaspoon of lose tea in a stainless steel infuser in a 16 oz mug let it steep in 208f water for 23 min take the infus out and drink it without sugar or milk to savor its sophistication I have try literally dozen of tea since be introduce to the russian custom of prepare and drink tea and the ahmad imperial blend be probably my favorite of all of these due to the fact that it be equally delicious hot or iced I buy the threepack as need from amazon and go through they rapidly my family love it and my friend have it in their home now too try one box of it and you will love it too this be an excellent tea one of the good I have ever have it be especially great when you prepare it with a samovar herbal additive in this blend destroy real tea taste it be only for people who like herbal taste I do not make a tasty super easy meal fast but high in calorie br br the instruction say to saute the veggie first but I recommend cook the chicken first the chicken take long to cook and the raw chicken ontop of veggie just make a slimy mess I make it with snow pea and carrot only I do not like the little corn add some red pepper flake for heat and serve ontop of rice it come out wonderful dinner on the table in less than 30min I think I have try just about every bloody mary mixer on the market at one time or the other most have too much sugar or bad corn syrup this mixer be all natural ingredient and very tasty it do have a little kick enjoy might be a little spicy for some but this stuff rock I use 12 and 12 with v8 for a milder version or the good be a bloody caesar br half mix half clamato take I one or two to get use to the pickle taste but now aim hook and have to keep a bottle on hand this candy be not as describe the middle be almost hard it be not a silky or smooth filling as describe br look and taste like its way past its expiration date br would never reccommend this pay a good chunk of cash for nothing I start drink the power slim tea when I be on the hcg diet to help curb craving since I like it so well I try some of the other and I be now hook they be so satisfying that I drink they all the time the energy give you that extra pickmeup in the afternoon that help keep I go all day no matter how long I m try several of the wu yi tea I like this one particularly because of the subtle citrus taste it also have a natural sweetness br br the ingredient include organic wuli cliff oolong tea 700 mg organic black tea 600 mg organic green tea extract 100 mg proprietary blend 600 mg plus some ginseng panax orange peel lemon grass and guarana other ingredient natual orange and citrus flavor br br my goal be to drink more tea and less coffee I be enjoy try a different kind of tea every day ill be come back to this one I can not live without this citron falksalt it be wonderful on watermelon fish almost any food require salt and in my world it all do just try it on red juicy watermelon wonderful experience terrible artificial lemon taste like pledge lemon furniture polish do not do this to yourself just use plain flake salt and some fresh grated lemon zest these thing be huge I love the way the crystal crunch and the flavor be not too overpower or too subtle this lemony flavor be my favoriteit good on almost everything you ll have plenty of flavor salt for a long time if you buy this the taste of these white cheddar flat bread be like a regular cracker which be not bad except that I buy they because I want a cheese taste br br what be a huge disappointment how misleading the packaging of the box be the photo on the box I buy these in store make it look like it be full of long flatbread expand the length and width of the box wrong the plastic tray that hold the cracker be about 2 small all around leave you with about 15 or so small flatbread br br what be also bad about this be that the company state they use biodegradable and ecofriendly package fail they use a huge box for a ridiculously small amount of cracker not ecofriendly at all br br would I buy these again no I feel rip off the other cracker like sesame tarragon give you a little br more bang for your buck and have more flavor this be the ultimate puppy food the kibble be great for small breed high in digestible nutrient as oppose to filler some company use less waste result from the high quality ingredient I have be hunt training show and handle various breed of dog for nearly 40 year with multiple national champion I have be highly satisfied with eukanubas quality and the result I have obtain feed their food my recent purchase be with wag through amazoncom their price be the good I have find and they be very good at ship immediately on item in stock the recommendation when we buy our puppy lhasa bichon mix and lhasa poodle mix be that we continue they on the food that they have have since be wean this be a somewhat expensive food so I can not say that we be terribly pleased but we load up on the stuff and head home br br let I just say this I have have small dog before never have I see such gas issue both of they consistently have foul gas consistently usually when they re sit on our lap but you know they re dog br br when we get through the first bag of this stuff we purchase more on amazon it be a great price for it since we get a 40 lb bag for the price of I think a 15 lb bag at petco but they continue to have gas I mean they love the food do not get I wrong and they love it more when we d mix in some water and it would be like soft food somehow that make their gas bad but I think ill have to give that responsible to the speed with which they chowe down can not blame the food itself for gluttony br br eventually we switch their food no more farting I think it be due to the high fat content which undoubtedly be necessary for very small puppy they just need that in their diet I think that we be advise to keep they on it for much long than be useful they say up until 1 year yeah right you try deal with gas for that long around 6 mos of age we switch to puppychow much well grant they do not like it as much but we human like it a whole lot well a very delicate green tea with a smooth light taste and an subtle floral tone and no bitter aftertaste br br in the 20 year we have be drink ahmad tea not even once have we be disappoint the superb quality of ahmad tea have remain consistent throughout the year br br I be so happy to find ahmad tea available here thank amazon because only a few store carry it in my area and they be quite a few mile away the current deal for the pack of 6 be superb much cheap than I can find locally br br this be a great tasting tea which I be happy to recommend fresh a great way to get a little chocolate in my life without a million calorie they taste just like chocolate pudding if you like the ceylon tea variety you will certainly enjoy and appreciate this tea br br I be so happy to find ahmad tea available here thank amazon and very surprised at the negative review from 2009 because in the 20 year we have be drink ahmad tea not even once have we be disappoint the superb quality of ahmad tea have remain consistent throughout the year br br the current deal for the pack of 4 be very good cheap than I can find locally br br highly recommend br br note this listing description be confuse each packet of tea weigh 500 gram which equal 11 pound or 176 ounce I ve be enjoy this tea for year this tea be good morning afternoon or evening my local store go out of buisiness thank amazon I use a bodum tea press to prepare a pot hi I have to have black tea everyday I have do it in the past 25 year and its a habit of mine ahmad tea be one of my favorite brand and I highly recommend it if you like black tea I think this be go to remain my favorite for the next 100 year or so I have try it out despite the other review and I find that this be exactly the same tea I buy in either russian or italian grocery ahmad tea be an excellent looseleaf tea eith hot or for make iced tea great flavor with no linger aftertaste I ve be drink this tea for the past 8 or 10 year usually buy a box or two when visit large metropolitan area where many middleeastern store carry loose ahmad tea usually at 57 for a pound box I ve always consider it an unremarkable but robust tea with enough aroma and taste and beautiful reddish color perhaps not good enough a tea to drink on its own but a decent base for mix br this tea however be nothing of the sort freshly open package have almost no characteristic tea smell and the brew tea be weak flat and tasteless somehow it just do not seem to be the same product anymore so you get a lot of tea for the money but the quality be such that you might as well drink lipton bag they be not that much bad I love love love this deal its way fun to pick from so many tea and chocolate and cider as well as many coffee the other outfit that assemble sampler be bore they do the choosing and from a much narrow range the seller here be very nice also and will answer question via email about the slightly confusing ordering method its easy if you want great packaging forget it they ship fast and the kup be just toss loose in a box who care once you ve try some random sampler pack and now be overload with decafs extra bold or tea this be a great way to get exactly the brand or style that you want receive the order in a couple of day and be exactly what I order this be my second order and ill be order this item again good product and fast shipping equal a happy I a little pricey but you can hand pick a few good flavor a few I can not find anywhere else so def worth the price if use on a daily basis you will keep your gum healty and between your tooth clean and free of plack wow this product be very impressive I buy the 8 oz blueberry and be pleased with packaging price and ship the powder dissolve instantly even in water I ve just be mix a 14 tsp in a small glass of water for now and drink it down and it taste great but will add it to my smoothie and juice fruit juice next this product be so economical compare to purchase fresh blueberry especially because there be no waste due to mold or overripe berry throw away I think you could add this to baked or unbaked food as well I m excited to add more of the superfood to my diet in this fast and easy way I definitely will be try the other flavor soon the pork chop from omaha steak be very tasty but at the same time exceptionally dry pork be usually dry meat but these be to the extreme possibly ship they frozen and keep they freeze be partly the problem five minute in one tentacle be bite off ball inside crack in half not durable enough to be a dog toy disappoint so be the dog I be chemical sensitive as well as sugarfree I have be use this product for over a year I use it maybe once a week at the most I drink 12 the bottle and then boost my energy after an hour or two depend on how I feel imo this do not replace my a m coffee but be sweet in the early afternoon when I start to fade once in a while I drink a full bottle before a workout I ve be drink guayaki yerba mate tea for year compare to the many toxic energy booster out there I highly recommend this this product be clean and do not leave nasty chem behind in the body try it before you judge from a review everyone body react differently I feel energized within five minute but it last for about 45 minute I pay 399 for this drink I could have just drink a cup of coffee and save my money yes its probably healthy than 5 hour energy or starbuck shot but if you re look to avoid a caffeine overload this be still not for you most energy drink can not be make w out a high dosage of caffeine I believe the caffeine content of 1 guayaki shot be 150 ml probably low than other unhealthy energy shot drink but I believe most other people avoid the top brand b c they contain too much caffeine and or sugar if you do not react well to caffeine guayaki be not a good buy either I definitely feel an energy boost w 1 full guayaki shoot but not w out all the other caffeine side effect irritability nervousness moodswing caffeine overdose be why I stop drink coffee but it look even organic energy drink be still not safe br br now you re not sensitive to caffeine then its a great buy its not load w sugar the taste be easy and pleasant its not load w a bunch of chemical like 5 hour shot or starbuck drink and the energy boost last for about 4 to 5 hour take about 5 to 7 minute to kick in but all this probably depend on your body weight br br side note if you want to feel energized during the day have a protein drink first thing in the morning and stay away for heavy fattening food during the day that will make you feel sluggish and sleepy these nature valley nut lover variety pack be perfect although I be not sure about the peanut butter bar it be excellent I love the roasted almond roasted pecan and the peanut butter br br I will definately buy from this seller again quick shipping and very fresh I so wish I would have read this review before purchase two gallon of this oil for my health issue it reek like a chemical rubber smell this smell be come from the black rubber gasket in the lid when I call to report the situation to the company sabrina tell I I would have to pay to send they a sample to have test by a lab unbelievable good customer service would indicate that they would pay for the product to be return and give I a full refund include ship the product be faulty period I will never order anything from this company again and do not recommend it to anyone base on this horrible customer service and lack of responsibility and ownership this product have a strong aftertaste of crayola crayon br br I be in the process of try different brand of coconut oil for cooking purpose upon open the plastic container the aroma of crayon immediately fill the room and this flavor permeate the food that be cook in it br br I suspect the source of the problem be the plastic use in the plastic container as I have not experience this with any of the other brand purchase br br to date my favorite coconut oil be distribute by barlean the flavor be fantastic however they do not supply a gallonsized tub and dr mercola have the good product in that size category have this ship to my sister who follow a glutenfree eating plan and she report that it be very versatile and easy than grind almond for a crispy crust on chicken and fish filet also use it in place of bread crumb in meatloaf and meatball stay moist when add in place of wheat flour in bake too good product good value these be healthy and my mixed llasa tibetan terrier adore they and they be healthy and his breath do not smell and his tooth be in good shape because of such product a great healthy product a great healthy chew for my 9 wk old beagle rio he love the taste and it sure beat my arm I really enjoy this product I have such a hard time find it affordable in the store once I find it I look no far its the only sugar I use thank so much I have use and like sugar in the raw for many year after be introduce to it in a starbuck my most recent purchase however be disappoint the sugar be light in color and have a crystal size maybe 14 th of the regular size have large crystal be something I always really like about sugar in the raw it enhance the quality of mixed drink and of latte I call their hotline to complain and be tell that they have have a problem with their recent sugar crop and that the result be less molasse in the sugar they have have many complaint of a similar nature this they claim also reduce the crystal size they say this problem should go away with their new crop the representative say that the newcrop sugar will have a 610 digit date code without any space that end with a 1 and no letter the trail digit be a date code use the julian calendar my recent badpurchase have a space after the initial sequence of number and then end with a 51a bottom line their current product be not much well than much cheap product when they get a well crop ill go back to purchase sugar in the raw sugar in the raw tm please harvest cane w o burn br to be deliver to hc s br dear sugar in the raw folk br br we who buy your product care about the environment and we d like to know that you care too when you burn the cane field on maui it add to the co2 and worsens climate change and the smoke from your burning be damage the lung of your worker your worker child and the resident of maui br br we love your product and want you to change to noburn harvesting so we can continue to buy it know we be not contribute to global warming and lung disease br br love this sugar I also get muscavado sugar and they be both great to use in place of regular white sugar recommend product be exactly as advertise what a saving at least half the retail price easy to store because of the individual packaging I use to buy this sugar for year I do not eat much sugar but still this sugar be call turbinado sugar but be misleading I pick this brand just because it say real turbinado sugar and other brand in the local food store that their sugar be brown because it be color with caramel or something br br how do I find out I need just a sweet water few day ago I put this sugar in the raw in the glass the water become brown and on the bottom of the glass I get just pure white sugar crystal what a shame on the producer u can try to put this sugar in your mouth and after few second you will spit out pure white crystal as well br br I m just wonder if the consumer can hold the company liable for such a practice its just sugar in the raw its flavor profile be much well then white sugar and its suppose to be well for you or something I just wish the bag be resealable this be a delicious sugar it have a pretty light brown color and delicious aroma but the granule be quite big however big than plain refined sugar this make be difficult to cream butter and sugar together but if you use it in a recipe where you will melt the sugar first before bake it or if you use it to brew beer and plan to boil it to melt it it be a great product it would be the perfect sugar if only the granule be a bit finer I only use raw sugar it do seem a little small than the normal crystal but it be still good will buy again this sugar be very good use this in your coffee cereal etc for a week and you ll never go back to white sugar white sugar will taste terrible plus from what I ve read this raw sugar contain a lot of mineral that be miss in our diet br br the product be deliver fast and wellpackage my only complaint be the price I wish I could find raw sugar cheap I would be happy to buy in bulk but this be the cheap I have find I think this be a great buy but as note by scott d the molasse content be not up to par I love the high molasse content sugar in the raw unfortunately what I purchase recently do not have the high molasse content and I have twelve 24 ounce bag I guess ill watch for the next crop I really love this sugar and pricewise its much cheap to buy it here on amazon compare to anywhere else love this sugar it taste so much well and be not as overly sweet tasting as regular sugar we ve use it in quite a few baking item and they always turn out very good the price that amazon have this set at be very good to and make it easy to use this for everyday stuff can not say anything bad about sugar in the raw I like it well than the other natural sugar well consistency and I know it do not matter but well color unfortunately one of the natural paper bag got tear a bit in the box it do not look like the box be damage so I can not tell how it happen but it be sort of pain to clean up half a bag that spill all over the inside of the box and our kitchen when I open it not sure what the solution be and i d order it again but if it happen again I d switch to one of the brand that ship in an unnatural plastic bag great service item arrive fast than expect very efficient will use this seller again I highly recommend this seller thank you for the excellent service please ignore the onestar comment if you check the bag the main ingredient be in fact whole grain brown rice and the second be rice flower with anything that be gluten free you have to add another binder which be where the corn flour come in for someone who have celiac disease and can not have sunchip because they contain wheat a key binder to any chip cookie or cereal this be an excellent product my spouse and I buy these a lot because they be gluten free and absolutely delicious good flavor ever I m addicted they be all good but these be by far the good I could live on these and there be no need for anymore to say so many healthy product do not taste very good or taste good when you first try they and then go downhill I ve have these chip on more than one occasion and they be very tasty I ve serve they to guest twice and both time they want to know what they be and where to get they its also nice to have something glutenfree for friend who be borderline diabetic but I would eat they anyway I find these crisp at our local walmart figure I would give they a try they be so yummy I may never go back to regular chip not that I be a big chip fan anyway the only problem be I can eat the entire bag in one sit I give these crisp a big thumb up this be one of the well tasting crisp I have ever eat I only buy it on special occassion because I know ill eat the whole bag I pay 179 for a 2 ounce pkg of these at lunch today I buy they because brown rice be a good carb as soon as I taste one and it taste like a corn chip I check the ingredient the name be deceptive these have masa corn flour list in the ingredient and it overwhelm the taste I will not buy these again I can get sunchip for less money and similar taste I use the rotel mild and I love this product so muchit save I on a daily basis if you re try to cook low fat healthy food and in a hurry this stuff make it so much easy ever notice that some can tomato have a weird tin can taste when you make spagehetti sauce or whatever for some reason this product do not have that it taste so good you can just dump it in with a can of bean heat and eat br br or add some chili powder and now you have chili soup I also make indian dish with this and spicey spaghetti sauce I also prefer this to most canned salsa so it work for thing like quesadilla if you drain the liquid off br br none of my local grocery store carry it at all nor do they carry anything like it so I have to pay amazon inflated price to order this by the case I do not like that I m pay a high price but I love love love the product the price on this product certainly raise my attention on compaire amazon price with the local store I can get a can of this rotel at my local kroger for 1 dissapointe howdy you all br br the actual product be very good i d rate the item a 4 on its own however its only one dollar at the local grocery and twenty eight dollar per twelve pack these be run almost two and a half dollar each br br as I say too expensive sigh I be really hope to get they at something approach the local cost br br take care br lee nothing wrong with the product but I sure have to mix it with lot of other ingredient to make it edible to I in texas I be call a babymouth not into very spicyhot food br br for comparison I m comfortable with tostitos medium chunky salsa 1 can of this milder rotel mix with 2 slightly large can of diced tomato be still way too hot for I to use as salsa for chip I use some of this to make a sort of southwestern cornbread that be good though this be a fantastic product and I wish it be readily available in most store its taste be not the great but its a 25 oz shot and its go in a second it taste more or less like a concentrated sweet tea for the record I ve have 5 hour energy and that taste far bad I will put up the taste for the result its get 150 mg of caffeine which be the equivalent of the big red bull and monster I can not stand sucralose and sugar substitute and this be one of the only shot sized energy drink that have only sugar in it the sugar be at 9 g which be not horrible I use to drink 4 16 oz red bull a day for the caffeine and this give I far well energy and be much more subtle my preference be black coffee but I can not drink 812 cup a day anymore overall steaz do it right real organic ingredient in moderate amount and they create big result I have to get up really early to work out before work and I get super tired by the middle of the afternoon I be drink one 5 hour energy usually extra strength each day it work well but give I a jittery feel almost headachy but not quite my husband get I to try this and I be skeptical but for I it work as well if not well than the 5 hour energy and do not give I that jittery almostheadache feeling br br I do not mind the tasteit remind I of the inside of a fig newton mmm and the price be ok on amazon anyway at my grocery store they be almost 3 each yike br br and its organicso I can feel good about it right its all about I feel good I buy these for my husband and he say they be the good energy shot out there he take one in the morning and work hard all day good stuff I be a energy junkie and I m not sure if this work or not but what I do know be that the taste be not the great I do drink the steaz energy drink and I think I get the same result I like this product because it be more natural then the other if you want an organic energy shoot your choice be this one from steaz and the assorted flavor from guayaki guayaki yerba mate be actually in the steaz energy shot and energy drink and they both use sambazon acai so there be some similarity in ingredient br br great energy burst for 4 hour on a steaz energy shot and no withdrawal or headache afterwards plan on drink one every day at lunch at work this will help I cut down on my iced coffee which be not help my calorie intake br br already order 12 pack on subscribe and save 2 per month great value I be look for a natural energy shot that work and I find it steaz energy shot be my favorite br br I recently have gastric bypass surgery so ton of sugar be a nono and I m also allergic to sucralose splenda so most other energy drink be out br br I try bazi energy shot and they do not work as well as steaz and definitely do not taste as well these have a taste that s almost like cocacolanot bad at all br br if you re look for natural energy give these a try I have try both of the guayaki energy shot and I do not like the taste of either of they this one have more natural caffeine and taste much well I like they cold for sure my husband and I take these on road trip in a little cooler with ice and water and we do not have to make stop for coffee especially on the turnpike where its just way too expensive its worth the per shot we normally split they I m really sensitive to caffeine even the natural kind so I get a little weird if I drink the whole thing but that s the same for coffee too for I my husband drink the whole shot and get a nice wake up boost I would recommend these over any of the sinthetic shot out there you can feel good about put this in your body ill be order again soon for sure I purchase it because it be on sale in term of the energy it provide it work but the taste leave something to be desire I try mix it with some water to make it more drinkable I ve be feel extremely tired around the late afternoon as a software engineer this be entirely unacceptable so I ask the nice lady at the counter of my local whole food market for something that will give I that extra energy I need to get through the day br br she excitedly return with a suspicious little green bottle over three hour after drink whatever that be my brain be still work at unnatural speed to summarize my experience I believe this work br br she do explain that I need to drink plenty of water with it which I personally feel help the energy level so if you re feel tired during the day and hate coffee give this a shot preferably before you eat anything br br woot the energy shot truly do work it have a terrible aftertaste at first but now that I know what to expect I be getting use to it I always have some water handy as a chaser which help I be so glad to have find something that give I the energy I need without all the chemical find in other beverage its help I kick my addiction to diet coke and other aspartamelace caffeinate beverage yay I ve try 5 hour energy red rain nos and other energy shot this be my favorite in term of taste and effect plus its somewhat reassuring to know that natural ingredient be use sometimes I wonder what I m really put into my body with some of the other brand I purchase a box about once every 2 month for the past 2 year if you re look for an energy boost without artificial sweetener and other chemical this be a great option the taste be decent and it be a nice smooth uplift without jitter I first find steaz berry energy shot at a local organic market I buy two bottle which cost just under three dollar each I fall in love instantly the drink be delicious I can taste the yerba mate and the acai juice like a slightly bitter fruity chocolate honey tea I be very sensitive to sucralose splenda which be in so many energy drink these day I also hate the taste I love that steaz have actual sugar and no artificial sweetener the rush it give I be slow and even I have several medical condition include fibromyalgia which sap I of energy and cause intense pain I like how steaz help clear away the fatigue and fog so I can get thing do no caffeine jitter even though there be 150 mg of caffeine in each bottle br it be become expensive for I to buy the bottle separately at store so I start look online for a bulk price I be so thrilled to have find the pack of 12 on amazon I sign up for amazon prime specifically for this product hah I have try other energy shot and this one be the only one that really make I feel good and energized without any other side effect at all its also the good taste other taste like medicine this one have a tea fresh taste I love it I drive otr over the road truck and this help to keep I alert it have no sugar high no crash I m on a autoship which I like the price be very good I ve see it over 2 buck in the store product take pretty good and it do not leave you gittery with subscibe and save as well as prime membership I pay below 2 a shot my wife try they and now she drink they like they be go out of style I moderate mine and they make for more effective use before weight training I recommend this product to anyone who be look for a healthy alternative to high sugar and unnatural product that be everywhere that still give you the result of an awesome energy drink I use this product daily and it provide a steady stream of energy I do not get jittery or crash it also help I practice portion control because it act as a slight appetite suppressant I ve be buy and drink this for over a year now and the energy boost be excellent with a continuous 6 hour effect the most recent shipment seem to have improve the flavor slightly as well or perhaps I m get more used to it I do not drink it for the flavor but its not as heinous as the fake flavor find in the other nonorganic energy shot this be the first time I ve really be mislead by other review on amazon I like 5 hr energy I find rain ok and so I think I d try this product base on the review boy be I sorry I gag get one bottle down even with my nose pinch really and it leave the bad medicinal taste in your mouth afterwards 8 tic tac at once do not get rid of it but bad of all within an hour I be yawn and drowsy unless you really like thing that taste of a weird teaflavored cough syrup and do not work do not buy this I do not know what to do with the other 11 bottle big fail I love this mold I wish I could have use it for more than one occasion but it do not last I do use it to make 30 sucker for my daughter first birthday but there be go to be no way that the mold could be salvage after that I would have like to have keep to use on other occasion but for the price it do not matter to I that much it serve its main purpose you have to try the vanilla tootsie roll the regular chocolate one be good but these be the good ever try this you might like it I do and I be quite addicted it be too easy to prepare it taste great and it absorb the flavor you cook it with the price be really good and well worth the purchase if you like this type of couscous like I do then give this one a tryit can be eat hot room temp or in a cold salad with a variety of green and other flavor it take on the other flavor very well when mixed I cook the couscous with a broth and oilive oil for add flavor and it rock my taste bud big time I will be back for more this tricolor couscous be really good full of flavor and fun to eat I love the texture I cook in chicken broth and add some mince garlic and chop herb parsley cilantro along with some red pepper flake at the end of cooking I add some olive oil and this make a wonderful side dish highly recommend I try to find israeli couscous in a number of upsacale grocery store and no luck so I decide to try good ole amazoncom and select this product it be so good add a few herb and its a great side dish or add more and make a pasta type saladso very good I be hook great flavor and so easy to prepare the package come with the label tear off and no cook instruction I know how I normally cook couscous so try 34 cup water to 1 cup couscousbrought to a boil and let sit cover for 5min it be mushy and tastelesswe have throw out the rest of the container I would not even think of buy this product unless I know the price per unit how can I compare other item online or in a store I love order whole bean coffee on amazon I like this so much that this my first product review I have to say that I m usually not a big fan of flavor coffee but I think I would give it a try when my husband start grind it up I could smell it throughout the house sometimes with flavor coffee the smell be there but the taste be not however not with this one I m now go to order another flavor from this company and will give it a try I love this coffee I do wish it came already grind as I do not have a grinder and use a blender instead but its worth it many flavor coffee I ve try only seem to have a flavor odor that do not reach the coffee but this one manage both this brand of coffee have be available in my local store for some time I ve believe the company be local I ve be drink it for quite some time and have not tired of it I m particularly fond of the turtle sundae but all the flavor be good I can not say that I ve have a bad one br br as it turn out its less expensive to order it from amazon and have it show up at my front door than it be for I to run out to the local walmart to get it its a no brainer try it if you like rich flavor coffee you ll like it it be hot I love it tasty and a little sweet I usually scoff at salsa label as hot but this one live up to its billing I consume about a jar every two week of this either add it to fajita or use it as a corn chip dip it be hot but after awhile the medium salsa suprema be too mild for I I think maybe I d cut down how much I eat by go to the hot salsa ranchera its hot enough that people who be not use to it will say that s hot br br flavor bright and forward the similarly hot salsa victoria be a dull taste to I I guess earthy this salsa be much bright in the mouth I do not like to go hotter than this because the sauce I ve try lose any resemblance to yummy salsa and just taste hot this happen to I with tabasco sauce for example br br a drawback be la victoria do not make a large bottle of salsa ranchera nor salsa victoria nor do they sell they in or sam club to get a good deal you have to watch for sale service be great but I mean to buy swiss chalet chicken sauce not the marinade br br love the sauce have yet to try the marinade use frequently as we like to do asian dish at least once a week love this product fast shipping as usual would buy again these individually wrap piece be delicious although I wish there be a few more mildly sweet with no sugarfree aftertaste even a traditional marzipanaholic should enjoy these put this in my husband stock for christmas and it be a hit I be amazed at how quickly it arrive it be a cute stocking stuffer but only ok as far as user appeal you get what you pay for toy be typical quality I expect I got take for a major ride on the shipping so we cancel the order it be cancel without any problem that be a positive note I love the convenience of the single the good creamer aroundtaste be just like the big bottle I can stick they in my purse and take they to work these creamer come in 4 pack of 25 I have take one to work and open one for home so far and have not find a single break or leak creamer yet I usually have way too much cream and sugar in my coffee but with these it be easy for I to cut down on the sweetness because I will not allow myself more than 2 creamer per cup I think this be definitely the good option for buy creamer from amazon since all the other listing have a lot of complaint about creamer break in shipping even though we be international delight fan we be not completely dissapointe by this product we have no problem with the shipment but the creamer itself be thin than international delight other than that we be happy d besides the obvious convenience and portability of the individual creamer I like this item specifically because of packaging I could not believe how many review I read about coffee creamer cup but many of the amazon creamer option both coffeemate and international delight have multiple negative review due to the shipment arrive with broken cup thank to sloppy packaging br br that be not an issue here the shipment arrive in four dispense box of 50 each as show in the photo those box be tightly pack in a thick cardboard box which could take a good beating before damage the inner box thus none of my cup be break no waste and no sloppy drippy mess plus the four box mean I could put one in the kitchen one in the bathroom we move our mini keurig there when we upgrade the kitchen keurig good idea my husband ever have and one at work with a reserve for whichever run out first br br if you be look for these mini creamer but deter like I be by the negative packaging review on other option this be your good bet as a bonus the auto delivery price be very reasonable this seller be very nice and the price be very good the only reason I stop orde be bacause I go to sugar free and at that time he do not have it but for those of you that do not have to watch there fat in take I would get this product from they I purchase these coffee mate single to use at work along with the coffee tea bag they re great because they do not require refrigeration I receive the item in a timely manner upon receipt I remove a pack to consume the poptart be stale and leave an awful taste in my mouth I find these new spring poptart and buy they on a whim my kid and I be amazed and delighted at the fun colorful amazingly detailed artwork on these poptart fantastic for after school snack lunch box and school treat tie with a ribbon for a bright thinking of you this spring gift the only challenge be find more in store way to go kelloggs fantastic product yes I be have a cup right now I go all over town look for this coffee after be invite to a non profit organization to a banquet and besides the delicious food they top it off with this amazing delicious coffee I pay and extra 20 buck to get it right way and it be worth the money highly recommend taste like it be stale will not order this again I have this coffee at a 50th year annerversery at a reception hall and have to have it this stuff taste nothing like the douwe egbert at the hall this be possibly stale coffee serveice delivery with the seller be excellent the product be not will not order again bad taste iam not sure if it be old or that how it taste I throw it right away I coudl not drink it this be honestly the good seasoning salt in all the land it tighten up any dish not spicy just perfectly season its perfect hence my purchase of this 35 oz mamma jamma the order arrive as advertise I have have only a few chance to use it but it be awesome the flavor be exactly what I hope for it may take I a while to finish the entire gallon but I will definnantly order again I like a lot of sesame oil and use it in salad regularly great quality flavor and aroma can not beat that its organic buy a set of two when my son be about 6 month and we start take they with we whenever we go out to eat I cut up cantaloupe apple banana even use sweet potato a few time just whatever I could get at the restaurant and it would keep my son busy long enough that I could actually eat its great because I do not have to be overly worried about he choke on big chunk and he get to try out new food I would not hesitate to buy this again I have a slightly different version of this different brand my son start use it around six month and he really enjoy it he do get messy if he eat something sticky or juicy like banana or watermelon but whatever anyway I also have trouble clean it until I try scrub it with a nail or vegetable brush that work pretty well it take some time but not as much as it would take to run food through a food mill or blender or cut it up then clean it up off he the chair the floor the dog I well you get the picture what a great idea my daughter love it br I do not think be difficult to wash I mean be not like just toss water and that s it but come on br absolutely recommend it this product be impossible to wash and actually get clean I could not get the food piece out to save my life I try scrub they out and even wash it in the dishwasher as it suggest I love this product for fruit and other food that I do not want my new baby to choke on I also use it to put ice in when my baby be teethe it work great for this as well as for the food I do not like banana in it thoughimpossible to get clean I love love love the idea of this product and my little one love love love to use it she get fresh fruit and other tasty thing and I do not have to worry about she choke the only drawback be that bit of food get stick in the mesh and the seam and be impossible to get out grant some food be more difficult than other and some do not cause that much of a problem banana however have pretty much destroy a couple of they while I love this product I think that next time I will get the one that have the removable and replaceable mesh bag the munchkin fresh food feeder be an okay product its kind of like sucking on food through a cloth while my daughter be interested in it for a little while she eventually lose interest I may introduce it back to she again and see how she react this product be amazing I know a few people with little one that use these and they love they super easy to clean and use when order these I be under the impression that there be 2 per package fyitheyre not only one per I order these for my coffee theme wedding when they arrive I have to fight off friend because they smell and taste so good I literally have to hide the box to the wedding they be a big hit on my wedding day and there be none leave over that we put on the table it be a great taste product for the low price I ve see these be delicious the chocolate be excellent and the espresso bean be the perfect roast for this purpose crunchy and not bitter a href chocolate cover espresso bean 5 pound a the product be exactly as advertised and fresh unfortunately I keep they in a candy dish in the office and they be go fast we need to reorder to keep up with demand these chocolate cover espresso bean be wonderful the chocolate be very dark and rich and the bean inside be a very delightful blend of flavor with just enough caffine to really give it a ze popchip be so good I have be follow weight watcher and lose 50 pound and be at my goal these popchip be my salty crunchy indulgence they taste so good I ve purchase dozen of bag of this pancake mix which be a great product by the way this be the high price I ve see whole food carry this item and its be on sale there for 999 that s canadian dollar too as I m in canada its even cheap on baker boxs own website and they re the company sell this product through amazon for a twopack they should be charge 20 or less what gives I think amazon be where you could find competitive price the sugar be sweet that can not be deny as advertise it do not melt when bake either however it will not do for your liege waffle gaufre what the large pebble of belgian pearl will do these grain be small think pretzel salt or seed pearl that s exactly what I be look for to bake some chouquette puff with small sugar pearl on top work great yum this be what I be look for and be miss it the taste be exactly the taste as the one make in india so just love it and remember my day back in india definitely recommend it I buy this strawberry extract hope to spruce up a strawberry wine that end up with less flavor than i d original expect a common problem in some fruit wine br br this be indeed good strawberry flavor just add to your sugary concoction be it a bake good a dessert or a drink to either give strawberry flavor or add to exist flavor and presto just about everyone will be lick their lip and maybe finger br br for those interested I find the right addition to a liquid volume to be 4 oz of extract per 1 gallon of liquid great stuff and dependable especially when there be a million brand out there to choose from I love the stuff for really high end desire I go with the apollo olive oil from california but I buy a whole lot more of this stuff and will buy it again and again I have not try or hear of till recently weaver not its my favorite I be run through the list of type they have look for a favorite and have not find one

chunk of chicken and vegetable and nice large noodle this soup be just so full bodied and be season just right I be so glad amazon carry this product I just can not find it here in vermont I have use this oil for several year and it be the good for eat with bread or cook I love the regular I use it on everything you will not be sorry you tired it great for dip bread and cooking omelet and green bean oh my gosh be this good like most people I ve be eat ketchup my whole life and never really think anything about it then hubby bring a jar of this home the tomato flavor be amazing I will never buy store ketchup every again sir kensington do a great job of update the classic ketchup with this wonderful product the refresh taste of this ketchup be a great update and now leave I disappoint when I m give heinz while out at a restaurant br br for you heinz die hard fan out there this be not the ketchup for you but for those of you who wish you always know what ketchup could be without the chemical aftertaste find in heinz be sure to give this ketchup a try br br do not forget the spiced variety purchase the pack with both the classic and spice variety for your first sir kensington experience be definitely the way to go this be ridiculous the good gourmet ketchup I have ever taste it be pricey but wow love this stuff it would make a great gift for someone who be hard to buy for but love their ketchup yummy the tomato be the star of the classic flavor it be clean and really fresh perfect on an avocado chicken sandwich br br the spicy flavor be more complex and be the good ketchup I have ever try it be so good I have now use it on food that would make I seem crazy the spicy version of this ketchup be not bad but it be too expensive the regular version be sweet as dessert horrible annie organic have a much well flavor and cost a lot less even heinz organic be a well deal I give it three star instead of two because it be in glass not plastic these condiment be overprice and terrible the classic be disgustingly sweet the spiced taste like a bad spicy marinara sauce from a chain restaurant I have be use porcini mushroom in my cooking for twenty plus year the roland extra fancy porcinis that I purchase from you be the good that I have ever use include the mushroom that I buy in italy and transport back to the usa I be pretty pleased with these mushroom they be mostly large piece rehydrate well and have good flavor i d estimate about 25 of the content be break into medium to small piece most likely due to the shake about in transit not a problem since I sometimes break the large piece into small one for some recipe there be a small amount perhaps an ounce or so of very small mincedsize dustlike piece still useful to add into gravy and the like nothing gets waste br br the label say it be a product of china and italy nothing be specify as to the proportion from each country br br I m quite fond of dry mushroom while they may lack the texture you can get only when use fresh one the convenience of always have they on hand be a big plus additionally I find the broth use to rehydrate they add a wonderful flavor to soup and stew to save time and add flavor I sometimes add the dry mushroom directly into the soup or stew without rehydrate they really help meld all the flavor together I also be fond of add some to the cooking water when boil pasta the pasta pick up a wonderful earthy flavor when it cook in the mushroominfuse water br br this be the first time I use the roland brand get it on a price dip from the amazon warehouse and would certainly buy they again highly recommend if you be a peanut lover these be for you much large than cocktail peanut six people on my christmas gift list ask for these every year the cashew be nice and big with the vast majority be whole there be a number of small piece at the bottom of the bag but that s pretty expect with so many cashew they make an absolutely excellent cashew brittle br br my order take just over a week to arrive which be pretty decent consider it be ship across the country they come double bag in clear plastic bag and in two 5 lb portion this be highly convenient since I could just throw one of the bag into the freezer until I be ready to work with it br br great value for the price although there be several shrivel one they taste just fine I mostly use they to make vegan sauce and other recipe that call for run they through a food processor so they do not have to look perfect anyways for the price they be a great deal about half of what I find they for in the store I order these after a fair bit of search online even order the small 13 oz bag I will admit I be a bit sceptical when I order this since it be not cheap and have no idea how good or bad the cashew would be br br the order come in pretty fast like 3 day the cashew be fresh and whole with like 10 break piece they be in 2 5 lb bag seal with clear tape first I find it odd but then it turn out to be a good deal consider the second pack stay fresh till I open they the trick be to actually keep they in an airtight box so that they stay fresh long br br the only negative I can think of be that the price go up abt 500 for the 10 lb since I buy they these nut arrive fresh and be very tasty they be not break or dirty look like cashew sometimes can I buy these for my boyfriend who really like honey roast pecan in salad that I have at a couple of restaurant plus he like nuts pecan almond peanut he love these I actually order 3 can instead of the gift tin so he could take one to work or his place and stay fresh long although I do not think freshness will be an issue they will not last long lol my cat will go for a day probably long have not try it but hell walk right by this stuff every time even when I know he s hungery absolutely no interest I swear he d rather die of starvation then even take a wiff of it get this free with another order I place I could not believe how much the cat love it I will buy again for sure this be a great ham soup base I have use it in ham and bean and seasoned greenbean great flavor I have not use the ham base it be load with msg I do not

they come very delicious and fluffy br just one small secret try to add the seltzer water instead of regular one I appreciate the fact that I can buy this product online and have free shipping this be a great all around mix that be very good with a wonderful texture thank again amazon arrowhead mills buttermilk pancake mix be my favorite mix it taste great cook up light and fluffy and be super easy

they many way I love the flour however amazon send it with a book which break a bag and make a mess customer sevice take care of the problem however it be a foolish way to ship the product this mix be very poorly package and break open easily during ship nearly a full bag of my order be spill in the shipping box 3 bag out of 4 have come unseal at the top there be no tear in the package just awful I think food be suppose to taste good I have to eat ice cream afterwards to get the taste out of my mouth its that bad perhaps the bad bottle of wine I ve ever have I m not even sure I would cook with this it be thin no body and a transparent color not characteristic of a good pinot the taste be just bitter not the complexity that I expect from a pinot noir of any price just not what I m look for even in a low to mid price pinot noir maybe my bottle be not seal well and go to vinegar other review for this wine be favorable a good tasting light chip that have some value in nutrition everyone get the munchie be this be a good alternative to eat potato chip this be a wonderful warm flavor tea especially now in cold weather br this tea have a sweet soothe chamomile fragrance it be subtle and sweetit s one of the well chamomile teas br if you find it hard to sleep at time a cup of this sweet chamomile tea may help br if you really like sweet taste try bigelow chamomile mango herbal tea br I highly recommend both this be one of the good mint chocolate syrup I ve ever have so far the other pale in flavor by comparison there be only seven ingredient in this sauce include organic natural mint flavor in the past I use ice cream heavy with other flavor like butterscotch chocolate chip oreo cookies caramel et al because the mint flavor of other mint chocolate sauce be too pale now I buy plain vanilla or chocolate ice cream and the minty flavor of the santa cruz organic mint chocolate syrup really stand out but do not overpower the flavor of the ice cream there be only 110 calorie and because the mint flavor be very apparent to my taste I use it sparingly so this 155 oz container last a bit long than the other syrup I use this be a simple product and it be simply good there be no extra ingredient that be hard to pronounce and have you scour the internet find out what they be it be a bit thin consistency than the usual syrup so use caution the first time you go to squeeze some out this will be great for people who like mint it have a much strong mint flavor than chocolate I use it in my coffee with a bit of half and half taste great sometimes simple be well a grande item delicious fish with the ultimate flavor well ever in a can for all purpose I send a case to my mother recently diagnose with diabete and she love it as a main entree for cooking patty I order this product at the same time as the kirkland signature salmon the raincoast trading co salmon be very tasty equally as good quality salmon as the kirkland however the raincoast arrive in perfect condition the kirkland can be dent badly I recommend this product to anyone who like boneless skinless can salmon this tea taste almost as good as the tea you would get at an indian restaurant its much well than get a teabag and make it the english way with a lot of water and a bit of milk this be very creamy and tasty my only criticism be that there be not enough sachet in the box only 10 since the direction say that you use one sachet for 100ml of water approximately half a cup its not enough for a good cup of tea so I use two that mean that one box be only good enough for five cup of tea but its a delicious afterdinner drink I would buy this again if there be more sachet in a box I love this product can not find it locally sometimes little out of the way store have itbut I also love the chicken pork chop bagsevery store I go in I look for they the lastplace I find it be at a meat market this be the good way to cook a roast our local grocery go out of buisness and so I could not find this product till I look here please continue to keep this product available its always a pleasure to find frenchs product on the web all of the market in my area have make a bargain to carry nothing but mccormack bland and tasteless seasoning br br this be the most flavorful cook bag mix you will ever find if you like oreo or the oreo cakester then you ve get to try the double stuff cakester these be the good side note shipping be very slow but maybe your chance will be well I be surprised about how good this be my family and friend laugh when I tell they I buy this but out of the can ready mix with a little salt pepper spinach and some cheese and its a great easy meal the thing about marmite be that those who do not like it hate it and those who love it can not live without it its very much an english thing and the language have even adopt the trade name as a metaphor as in victoria beckham be marmite mean that those who do not like her etc amazon have do the world a favor by make this weird and wonderful stuff available at an affordable price last time I look it be 25 a 500 g jar in british store in lacounty or about 4x what it cost in england the amazon supplier be quick and efficient and I now have enough marmite to last I to the end of the year or would have if I do not decide to send one of the two jar to my son in japan good job amazon a vile miserable pancake I put these in front of my toddler one morning and she actually cry I do not know if it be their flat and anemic appearance or their salty bitter taste only the whole wheat flour be organic in this mix the buttermilk bake soda sls and sea salt be not I be go back to nature path buttermilk pancake mix this one go straight into the garbage what s there to say about a fantastic chocolate chip cookie the only thing that could be improve be if they offer a bushel box of these so you would not run out so fast hope these do not go the way of the dinosaur these arrive on time and package in green plastic wrap the cookie be as fresh as the box find in the local grocery store br br I have no complaint but I also now have no more cookie we eat they all I be not expect to like these cookie as much as I do I like chocolate chip cookie well enough but I really prefer a soft cookie to crisp one I have to say these famous amos cookie have pertty much turn I around the cookie be rich and have that depth of flavor that come from quality ingredient the chip be real chocolate and melt redilly in your mouth create a moist experience while chew these be truly great cookie they be not fatten and they re good for you right that s what I hear at least from an admittedly unreliable person great if you be cut back on fat they do resemble regular chip but be nothing like they extremely dry and hard I have never meet a kettle brand chip I do not like these chip have a great loaded potato flavor which be flavorful I like the sweet onion chip well but these be also at the top of the list for greattaste potato chip kettle chip be great chip f the money after buy bag one at a time at a hefty markup at nearby store I decide to try bulk order some snack food on amazon I be very pleased with the price and the product br br these jalapeno kettle chip be not overly spicy they have a slowbuilde spice that start very subtly a grow if you eat the whole bag which I m embarrassed to say I do quite a few time br br the chip arrive wellpacke and fresh they have nearly a year of time before they expire which be pretty impressive for chip br br most importantly the priceperbag be much much well than any local store could do although I live near an expensive city so that may play a role in the price difference br br I would not hesitate to order another box of these once I run out I buy mostly for vend so the size of the bag be important kettle 1 oz bag be a good size although it seem a bit less than full salt vinegar flavor be satisfy about an 8 out of 10 glad to find these in a one ounce size but the bag seem a bit less than full its hard to find single serve chip bag that vend well sometimes they be too wide or too plump with air bag size be good bbq flavor be about an 8 out of 10 one of the good chip that you can buy and I ve try all the kettle variety and many other there s only a slight taste of jalapeno and they be delicious perfect with a sandwich or alone br if you like be addict these be the chip for you see you at addict anonymous the title say it all great flavor hint of spice excellent crunch we eat kettle chip by the truck load at my house we like all the flavor but this one far and away be our favorite never enough bag to get we to our next shipment I just wish amazon could get the large bag on subscribe and save if you buy these make sure you have enough for everyone otherwise you may not get enough for yourself wow I have eat quite a few potato chip in my day kettle chip be the well nonbake chip I have eat I decide to try the sweet onion chip since I ve never have they I now have a favorite if you like onion this be a must buy I will definitely reorder these as I mention above they be the good I have ever eat the flavor be great I can not say how much I love kettle brand potato chip kettle brand have a large variety of unique flavor and the quality of the chip themselves blow all other potato chip out of the water the ingredient list be print on each bag and the only thing really bad for it be the oil they be fry the chip in I love that these be not fill with nasty chemical I order the cheddar and sour cream krinkle cut one which be great but I be tear between the a href kettle brand potato chip fully load baked potato 2 ounce pack of 24 a and the jalapeno flavor while I know the jalapeno flavor be good but this be way well they include liquid smoke instead of actual bacon which I m fine with since I ve a vegetarian I order this to give to guest come from out of town for my wedding this spring and I can not guarantee how many I will have leave my fiance and I love these the packaging be perfect for anyone who be give these to kid to take for school lunch or hand out in gift bag even just for portion control now I have not do a sidebyside comparison but these chip still taste like the real deal these snack size bag do as well as the regular brand at the grocery store I work for portion control and reduce fat yes please with the subscribe save these be much cheap than at the grocery store I love kettle brand chip br I ve be in love with the honey dijon for year and decide to try out their other flavor br br sea salt vinegar chip be tangy sour and make my lip pucker when I eat too many at a time I get 12 big bag for a steal from amazon 11 what br br personally the flavor be too much for I but my mom aunt love they and they hate potato chip these chip be thick and crunchy I absolutely love they the taste be perfect I like to buy these small bag because I can not trust myself with a large bag of these because they taste no good I enjoy these chip I get these instead of my usual jalapeno one from the same company for a bit of flavor change I think those be well but only slightly like the jalapeno there be a great amount of flavor without be too overpower the small bag size prevent you from overeat as with a large bag I love these chip I buy the 24 pack once a month the bag be just the right size for snacking and prevent I from eat way too much with the large bag the jalapeno spice be subtle enough not to be overpower but still give you a great amount of flavor these be the strong tasting salt and vinegar chip I ve have I could still do with more vinegar flavor but I think this be as close as I m go to get without douse they with vinegar powder myself br br I do a side by side with the cape cod salt and vinegar and these be about twice as flavorful additionally as other reviewer have say they have quite a good bit of potassium in they somewhere in the neighbor of 15 rda per serve I have be order the sea salt chip for about a year I love they but my daughter pick some of these up at our local grocery store and now they be my new favoritewill be order they these be my favorite glutenfree dairyfree flavor chip many other salt and vinegar chip contain dairy so its nice to find one that I can eat the vinegar flavor be really intense and good these kettle brand potato chip in the spicy thai flavor really do taste like food I have eat at a thai restaurant the ingredient list include garlic powder onion powder parsley jalapeno and spice I m not sure what other spice there be but it sure taste like lemongrass to I yum these chip be thick cut and very crunch they come in a seriously heavyduty bag I try to open it like I do regular chip bag by pull the two side apart no way the bag be so thick I wonder if it be plastic I start look for the scissor and decide that any company that put their chip in a bag this nice must have provide a way to open it sure enough there be a small slit on the top and the simple direction tear here so easy why do not I think of that honey dijon flavor okay flavor but both my girlfriend and I think they leave a bad aftertaste the aftertaste be sort of like old cheese presumably some folk like this I m not a fancy cheese eater and it linger for at least an hour I d give this flavor a rating of 2 star out of 5 br br we have also try the ny cheddar flavor 4 star which we both like well and they do not leave any longlingering or bad aftertaste br br i d give the consistency of the chip 4 star the chip be crunchy but also greasy enough that I keep a napkin near or wash my hand after eat kettle chip for I kettle be the good brand on the market they really know how to turn the humble potato into something fit for the god I do not think anything could top their salt and pepper chip but these be my new favorite the flavor be pure and real they go great with just about everything and be highly addictive I hope they come out with a low fat version their low fat chip be excellent but they need more flavor salt and vinegar chip be definitely my favorite type of any potato chip these one make by kettle be very tasty and I enjoy they thoroughly I just wish there be a more healthy option with the same great taste what I like about they br 1 very thick chip br 2 no trans fat and all natural accord to the info on the bag br 3 flavor but that s a subjective thing br 4 2 oz bag which keep you from eat too much at one time just set a limit of 1 bag br br cons br as another reviewer say there s a lot of oil in they chip what I do be place a paper napkin on a plate and pour the chip on they wait a few min before eat and the napkin will soak some of the oil off it seem gross that there be so much oil on the chip that a napkin will soak it off but its true and at least this way you ll get rid of some of the oil these be so tangy it prevent I from eat too many a handful or two do the trick very crisp and savory I usually love kettle chip and love salt vinegar but these chip be way too vinegary for I they do have the typical kettle chip crunch but be too aggressively flavor for my taste I have always be a fan of kettle chip when you open a bag of kettle chip you know you be go to get quality these chip be no exception and live up to the name print on the package br br the new york cheddar chip have a very subtle flavor to they you can taste the cheddar in they but it do not smack you in the face like supermarket brand chip might the taste linger as well which be a definite plus br br another aspect about these kettle chip be the fact every chip be nice and crisp that crunch in your mouth on top of that there be no burn chip in any of the bag I have have since the purchase the only negative I might have be that the flavoring of the chip be uneven some chip might pack a nice cheddar punch while another might taste rather plain this be not a big flaw as it happen when getting season and do not ruin the bag at all br br overall the quality of the chip be fantastic the flavor be great and you will not be disappoint especially if you be a cheddar lover try many variety of bbq chip and hand down these be the good on the market these r not too salty or greasy great crispy crunch plenty of good bbq flavor with a hint of sweetness that all other brand fall short of every bag after bag be just as mouth wateringly delicious as the 1st kettle chis be the good ever these use to be my favorite flavor until I try their salt and pepper kind but I m sure this be just a personal preference br br crunchy real potato chip these chip have the right amount of crunch and I enjoy the taste chip be consistent and have a fairly even distribution of season I like the 2 oz size bag just the right amount of chip I subscribe to these one case every three month that come out to about 5 a month for the convenience of have my favorite chip handy whenever I want because it seem fritolay have manage to crowd out every other chip vendor from pretty much all my local store this be the good way to ensure a steady supply of the item I want rather than the item fritolay want I to have the two ounce bag be large than you might be use to buy at the subway for example which I find work very well they re large enough to be a good snack on their own or you can even share a single bag over lunch the size be perfect for ensure these fantastically crunchy chip be always fresh no chip clip need br br the only problem I subscribe to four case a year and have these yummy chip always in the pantry make it really easy to increase one kettle chip consumption definitely have to hide the case from the kid ok I do read the review which range from splendid to awful I take the plunge as I do like salty and tangy flavor no I have never have these before I take the leap and order a case at a super price they arrive quickly and in great shape with the sell by date feb 2011 umm I m in the middle on these chip they be ok but not something I can not live without I love the crunch the color no trans fat they be a little too vinegary for my taste which be a lot come from a kid that grow up eat pickle hardboile egg and pickle pig foot br br I have not try they with a deli sandwich and a cold mug of beer which might improve the experience this be the good deal ever the delivery be fast the chip be delicious and very fresh love it my husband and I love these chip personally I think the flavor be perfect try they for yourself the barbeque flavor of these chip be really perfect just spicy enough a hint of sweetness just a little smokey the chip themselves be extra crunchy and just thick enough to be substantial but not hard this make for a wonderful snack or a great accompaniment for burger hot dog or brat chicken or just about any casual entree I be hesitant to buy this at my local grocery store lund but they be on sale so I buy a bag I ve find that go beyond the simplyflavore chip like cheddar or vinegar usually result in disappointment try the thai or asianinspire chip by target archer farm and they be awful these kettle spicy thai chip be just awesome so much so that I m consider buy they in bulk from amazon the taste be complicated and stimulate different part of the palate the taste sensation prevalent in real thai food be bake into this chip sweet salty spicy be sour in there too I do not know but this be a wellmade wellbalanced chip that be addict as a professional potato chip muncher I see these as thee very well on the market rich taste and flavor almost impossible not to finish the entire bagthe true meaning of decadence these be handsdown the absolute good salt vinegar chip you can buy they have a great strong flavor that have leave I addicted these be certainly my favorite chip I highly recommend try they oh I love these chip and they re so hard to find where I be and when I do find they they re usually 12 more per bag for less great that these be so cheap here at amazon I love these chip it be a little weird to review potato chip but these chip be great the crunch be just right plus they have just the right amount of salt not to salty not too bland they be a little oily but that s ok the good thing be the 2 oz package when I buy a large bag its hard to resist eat they all this 2 oz package allow for a little portion control be sure to use your scissor to open cause these chip be package for freshness and do not open easily enjoy in the past couple year I have eat and review several kind and style of chip from the good I ve ever have to big disappointment if you have eat the lantchip variety there be no way that they be not the good as a group the kettle chip be rightly salt and I be so irritated by some pringle product kettle have good flavor but the small size and overwhelming oiliness take away from the flavor all in all its good to have choiceamazon do not stock the lantchip all the time so there be some day that there be no choice these chip be good and bad and create moral dilemma constantly if wou be strong at will or have a large bbq go for it but as for I I be in the habit of bring a new bag to work every three day have to put in a lot of time on the treadmill to make up for it beware kettle chip flavor can be hit or miss some of their flavor be terrible but this be very simple and delicious probably one of their good flavor br br pros thick crunchy potato chip with light salt that do not compromise on taste ecofriendly business that be not just give we lip service br br con the occasional burn chip and the bag be a pain to open they have a tab that you can pull down but most of the time I end up tear down the entire side of the bag use scissor instead we buy these chip at a little sandwich shop in sonoma while we be on vacation I be not sure what to expect by the package and at first bite I do not know what to think and then all of the flavor hit br yum they be a bit spicy but nothing overpower just lot of crunchy sweet spicy goodness they be not sell everywhere though I m still try to find they somewhere close to where I live I have to admit that those chip be so good that they be highly addictive I can not stop eat they its crunchy and season at the right amount of flavor and salt just perfect believe I some chip be so salty I can not finish a small bag but this one I just keep on eat these be some of the good chip that I have ever have they sure beat anything else out there and be even cook in a way that be well for you than most other name brand they be tangy and crisp and satisfy any craving at the time these will be the only chip that I buy from now on and I thank amazon for let I buy they online in bulk and save some money at the same time I m addicted to salty and tangy flavor so when I open my first bag of sea salt vinegar kettle brand chip I know I have a perfect complement to my vegetable tray of cucumber carrot celery and cherry tomato skip the dip balance the tangy chip by alternate bite of raw vegetable br br as an oregonian I m proud to share these delectable snack with friend especially those live outside our state and who have not experience gourmet chip I tell they kettle brand do for potato chip what microbrew do for beer br br kettle brand potato chip be unmistakablea light gold color rich flavor and amazing crunch kettle

germanstyle riesling fit these parameter perfectly these chip remind I of a long obsolete brand of chip we could get in middle school they be by far the tasty chip I ve have and its impossible to walk past the aisle without pick up the trademark blue bag and then put the bag clip on the bag these be by far my favorite chip they be extremely crunchy similar to other kettle style chip but its the extreme vinegar flavor that differentiate these from less fry potato snack I ve try several other brand of salt and vinegar and none of they come close they be good but need more cheese and wish they be krinkle cut I much prefer the salt pepper just for the krinkle cut they have a well texture all around this brand be much well than fritolay and a good price on amazon when you get free shipping these be similar to tim or zack chip in that they be very crispy br br on a side note these be the hard bag to open by hand I have to use a knife or scissor everytime it take a while to get use to these chip but they be pretty good and more healthy for you they sure be eat all up by my family and friend these be delicious the 2 oz bag be a bit big for school lunch definitely more than a serve I recently try this flavor brand and be surprised at how delicious these chip be the good thing be that there be a lot of brown chip in the bsg my favorite so I buy some more through amazon and share with family and friend I be a little disappointed that there be not so far very many brown chip in these bag but the flavor be still very good I like they well than the yogurt and green onion flavor because they do not seem to be as salty and the onion flavor be well if you have not eat kettle chip before I recommend that you try a bag before buy bulk they be thick and crunchi than lay but just as fresh out of the bag we be always pleased with amazon packaging chip be never crush or break always fresh we really like this brand flavor of chip very tasty these chip be some of the good I ve taste they be not fill with chemical you taste the tangy vinegar as well as the potato not greasy perfectly crispy if you do not like salt and vinegar tanginess do not even bother to try these definitely have zip I love they my child and their friend love they even my 4 year old love they these chip be a great deal kettle be have a special deal for the case of chip they be hard to find in vegas and be my favorite flavor shipping be very fast soon than expect fantastic you can not beat this taste and you can not resist to it only one if you be spice lover eat at your own risk once I would open a bag I could not stop good and salty I do not eat many chip but these I love great buy and arrive quick and pack great expiration date be a way away so I have awhile to enjoy they great natural potato flavor I love brown russet hardy flavor and these fit that description to a tee I simply fall in love with these chip and refuse to share they with my friend my experience with a lot of cheesefavore chip have be too salty and a little over the greasy side but these ny cheddar from kettle really change my mind thank to amazon for great discount and I do not have to buy they from the store anymore buy this box of chip as a father day gift because dad love they they be very yummy and more substantial than regular chip these chip be quite tasty and the price be right package very well would buy again I like kettle chip but be really disappointed with this order because they be over cook I buy a big sized bag from costco and the chip be all cook perfectly so I do not know why these be different br will never buy these chip from here again for some reason amazon would not ship these to alaska so I send they to my grandchild who get to enjoy they they be very good chip amazon should rethink the shipping to alaska thing I would order grocery online my husband like these a lot they be a bit different to get use to as they be less greasy and salty in taste than the usual chip you buy they be more browner than I would like to see and the chip be pretty sturdy in texture not bad though just take getting use to eat chip well for your health they do have about 12 the calorie in fat however just get this order and it be ok a bit light on the cheddar flavor and herb taste elude I if it be there I really love kettle brand chip but these be rather disappointing there be very little sour cream or onion flavor I take one and say good russet potato chip but I find that the flavoring be subtle for my taste a bit oily and overcook it may be because I be use to eat their great taste a href kettle chip spicy thai 2 ounce bag pack of 24 a or perhaps because all the chip in the bag I receive be overcook and that overpower the seasoning it be obvious the chip be flavor but if I do not read the bag I would never have think it have cheddar flavor and I love new york cheddar the flavor include parmesan cheddar blue cheese garlic and other spice a good chip even when overcooked but I do not plan to buy they again I take one and say good russet potato chip but where be the flavoring then all of a sudden within second it spread to my sense and my taste bud be happy as close to thai food as a potato chip can get these chip be spicy enough to satisfy that craving for spice and a hint of sweetness that make they habit form the flavor include garlic ginger jalapeno cilantro and other spice and it just feel great to eat these I will buy these again these be a treat I agree with the other review these chip be not for a sore mouth or tender gum the chip be very hard and the taste be delightful if you enjoy the salt vinegar combo unfortunately every bag I receive in that case be over cook they be very dark and only a few golden brown chip in each bag they definitely need to improve that we love kettle chip lightly salt and do not feel guilty eat they we use to buy they at whole food but buy from amazon have save we money we have purchase at least 3 time and have be happy with the chip and the delivery a friend of mine bring these into work with the claim these will change your life while my life be fairly unchanged I can not get enough of these chip and I do not even like kettle chip for the most part I find kettle chip to be too thick and greasy but the flavor of these chip be amazing the be the type of hot that be refreshing if you do not enjoy spicy or hot thing try these anyway they may convert you but if you happen to like I there be no well sea salt and vinegar chip I ve find in this country these be the good potato chip I ve ever taste its easy to go through half of a bag without stop the texture crunchiness be just perfect as be the salt and vinegar combination I do not know how they taste so much well than all of the other chip I ve ever have but they do and judge from the nutrition fact they seem to be healthy too they re somewhat fibrous and have a good bit of potassium and vitamin c which could be because they do not skin the potato and the chip be a bit thick than normal br br and if you like these all of the kettle chip be great I rarely eat chip but I see these and try they they be really amazing I love cheddar too but the chip be really thin and crunch and delicious flavor I recommend they this be easily the good potato chip that I have ever have look at the ingredient ginger and 3 type of hot pepper how can you go wrong br br obviously not for you if you do not like spicy food but if you do like spicy food you ll probably love these they have that hotwithahintofsweetness flavor combo that be prevalent in a lot of thai food kettle chips spicy thai potato chip have the perfect amount of sweet savory and spicy everything you d want in a good meal or well yet a potato chip since these be kettlecooke the chip be uniquely shape and be sometimes a bit overbrowned they be however slice just perfectly not too thick not too thin so you can actually get a great crunch with each bite without break a tooth off the flavor be tremendous although I would not describe it as thai its more of a vague sweet and tangy flavor with a kick and every now and then you get a great big hit of ginger if you like any spice at all these really be not overly spicy so most people can handle they the fact that these chip have absolutely no artificial ingredient or trans fat make they a fabulous addition to any muncher snack cupboard okay I should not eat potato chip nor should anyone br but these be so spicy I would find it hard to eat br very many that make they an indulgence that br rescue some people from overindulgence I do not write very many review but I have to say that kettle brand chip be the good I have ever taste every flavor be dynamite if you be feel iffy about honey dijon I would recommend cheddar beer absolutely amazing and they re healthy besides a lil fat I have eat a lot of chip in my day and kettle take the cake enjoy and do not eat they too fast'"
